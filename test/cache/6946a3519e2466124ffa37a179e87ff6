Long story short, Boxer Hockey will end its run as a webcomic soon in order to get ready to go to print as a serialized comic. The current storyline will continue for another couple months though, so that I can come to a suitable stopping point for you all. What sucks the most, is I have the next arc all written out and it's some of the funniest stuff I've written. But you'll just have to look forward to it in the book, I guess.

Though since it won't be for polished works or anything, you can expect to see updates there much more frequently than here or my deviantart site. The store will also be re-opening shortly, now that the last of the international orders have shipped. Be expecting them in your mailboxes shortly. I'm going to try and make a new print of the girls, but I want to progress a little further in the story first.
