<p>But I had a lot of fun anyways. I also secretly recorded people playing. I&#8217;m not going to out any of the players, but I will say that I may have mentioned some of them already in this post. Enjoy!</p>

<p>Sorry I&#8217;ve been a bit MIA for the past.. uh.. two months. Things have been a little crazy. The holidays in particular were a very busy time and things are just starting to settle back into a somewhat irregular rhythm.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to try to get back into regular updates, but I&#8217;m starting with a sad one.</p>
<p>My grandfather passed away on January 9th, 2009 at the ripe old age of 92. He was an enormous part of our lives and he will be dearly missed. He lived a full and very busy life and it was clear by the number of people at the funeral service that he had a very huge impact on everyone he met.</p>
<p>I spoke during the service along with my cousin, my dad and one of Grandpa&#8217;s good friends. It was a beautiful service and I want to say again how much we all appreciated the support and kind words.</p>
<p>Here is what I said at the service:</p>
<blockquote><p>Last year I went to the <a href="http://eimaj.net/how-to-be-immortal/">Remembrance Day ceremony at the Swansea Memorial Library</a> in Toronto. At the service my great grandfather, Arthur Thomas Allen, was remembered for his service in WWI. The Swansea Historical Foundation dedicated a giant hand-painted mural to him and 21 other fallen soldiers from Swansea. Each soldier was also remembered through a plaque.</p>
<p>Grandpa was there and there were also a number of the boys from his old scout troop. The ceremony and seeing Grandpa talking with his old Scouts got me thinking about being remembered and living beyond your time.</p>
<p>Throughout Grandpa&#8217;s lifetime he inspired and led a number of people and organizations. I don&#8217;t doubt that he left an impression on every one of them. Many of the people who have met him, refer to him as one of the people who inspired, motivated and influenced them.</p>
<p>Everyone here probably has a story or two about him. I know his family could talk for hours about some of the games we played or the antics that would invariably happen at fancy restaurants. We could probably re-tell most of his stories and jokes almost as well as he could.</p>
<p>Grandpa&#8217;s story is ours now. Through our telling of it he will live forever.</p>
<p>The other night while I was writing this I was reminded of the movie, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0319061/" target="_blank"><em>Big Fish</em></a>. So I watched it. I&#8217;d like to end with a quote from it that I think sums up what I&#8217;m trying to say:</p>
<p>&#8220;A man tells his stories so many times, that he becomes his stories. They live on after him. And in that way he becomes immortal.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

My great grandfather and twenty-one other soldiers were being remembered for their service in WWI with a giant mural at the Swansea Memorial Library. Arthur Thomas Allen was a bombadier who never came home. My grandfather never met his dad.</p>
<p>The mural was revealed following the service.  It depicted the history of the area and included a plaque for each of the twenty-two soldiers from the area who never came home, including my great grandfather.</p>
<p><img class="alignright" style="float: right;" title="L to R: Eileen Allen aka Grandma, Joyce Jennison, Tom Allen aka Grandpa" src="http://eimaj.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/remember.jpg" alt="L to R: Eileen Allen aka Grandma, Joyce Jennison, Tom Allen aka Grandpa" width="200" />My grandfather, Thomas Allen (the third), is now 92. During his life he has inspired and led a number of organizations from Scouts to Kiwanis to Ontario Hydro.  He?s been married to my grandmother, Eileen, for 64 years and they?re still going strong.</p>
<p>At the service there were a few of the old boys from his scout troop and it was great to watch them talk and reminisce. The thing I found most interesting was to see what these boys had done with their lives. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Crombie" target="_blank">David Crombie</a> was the Mayor of Toronto, a federal MP and is still active in the political community. Norman McLeod led the creation of the Swansea WWI memorial mural and is a prominent member of the <a href="http://www.swanseatownhall.ca/" target="_blank">Swansea Community</a>. Bill Tennison is still a Scout leader himself after more than 60 years in scouting. All are still very active in the community and regard my grandfather as the one of the people in their lives who inspired and influenced them.</p>
<p>I think this is one of my grandfather&#8217;s legacies. He has and still does inspire, motivate and entertain everyone he meets and every one of those people will always remember him for it.</p>
<p>This got me thinking. Is there anyone who I?ve encountered in my life who are now doing really huge things? Have my actions inspired them in any way? I can think of a few people and I think they know who they are. I?m really proud of the things they?re doing and I hope they keep it up. They?re changing the world.</p>
<p>To me this is what immortality is. Not the things that we collect and pass on to our survivors, not trying to physically live forever but the memories and the people that continue our lives beyond our physical lifespan. All those intangible, immeasurable things that are passed on through memory and story.</p>
<p>How about you? What will your legacy be?</p>

First, a bit of context </strong><br />
I work at <a href="http://socialmediagroup.com/" target="_blank">Social Media Group</a> and, because of the nature of our work, I am online pretty much all the time. This has it&#8217;s pros and cons. <em></em></p>

<p><em>Con:</em> If I don&#8217;t have an internet connection I&#8217;m screwed? and I can get very bored.</p>
<p><strong>MAMP</strong> <a href="http://www.mamp.info/en/index.php" target="_blank">[website]</a><br />

With MAMP I can continue to toil away on a wordpress theme or plugin without a) being connected to the internet and b) breaking a live website I&#8217;m working on irreversibly.

<p><strong>1Password</strong> <a href="http://agilewebsolutions.com/products/1Password" target="_blank">[website]</a><br />
<a href="http://agilewebsolutions.com/products/1Password" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft alignnone size-medium wp-image-87" style="float: left; padding:6px; margin-top:10px;" title="1password" src="http://eimaj.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/1password.png" alt="" width="32" height="32" /></a>I was introduced to this app at <a href="http://wordcamptoronto.com/" target="_blank">Wordcamp Toronto</a>. Between work, clients and my personal life I have tons of passwords and logins to remember. Writing them down is sometimes a bad idea, but as one person noted at Wordcamp &#8212; If somebody breaks into your house to steal your passwords, you may have bigger problems.  Using the same password over and over is also NOT a good way to do things. Don&#8217;t learn this the hard way.</p>
<p>1password is a secure solution to this problem. The app collects, oober-encrypts and stores your web passwords in an encrypted database on encrypted servers in an encrypted location. To access your passwords you need one master password and the app. The obvious upside of this is that it is much easier to remember one super complicated password than several easy-to-remember ones. One license can also be used on several computers, which is handy when you use more than one computer on a regular basis.  As part of the app, 1password also has a password generator which helps you create completely random, secure passwords.</p>
<p>If you are concerned about the security of this at all check <a href="http://agilewebsolutions.com/products/1Password" target="_blank">their website for the details</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Dropbox</strong> <a href="http://www.getdropbox.com/" target="_blank">[website]</a><br />
<a href="http://www.getdropbox.com/" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft alignnone size-medium wp-image-89" style="float: left; padding:6px; margin-top:10px;" title="dropbox" src="http://eimaj.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/dropbox.png" alt="" width="32" height="32" /></a>This my keystone. Dropbox is an online dropbox that shows up on your computer like a folder in finder. It stores, backs things up and syncs your files just as quick as if you were working directly on your computer.  You can also create public folders online where people can go to access the files you want to share.</p>
<p>What this app allows me to do is sync things between my work and home computers. For example, my 1password keychain is located in my Dropbox so that I have access to all my passwords on both computers <a href="http://webworkerdaily.com/2008/09/29/1password-dropbox-sync/" target="_blank">[here's how]</a>. When I am working on a site on MAMP, I can use a folder in my Dropbox as the root directory allowing me to work on the same design from both computers. And because it is all stored online I don&#8217;t need to keep my computer at work on to access these files.</p>
<p><strong>Spanning Sync</strong> <a href="http://spanningsync.com/" target="_blank">[website]</a><br />
<a href="http://spanningsync.com/" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-90" title="spanning-sync" src="http://eimaj.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/spanning-sync.png" alt="" style="float:left;  padding:6px; margin-top:10px;" width="32" height="32" /></a>This app syncs my calendars. This is by far the most useful app I use, because it reminds me of where I need to be and when. At work we use Google Calendars to set up meetings and see when co-workers are free. I use iCal and my iPod to keep track of where I am supposed to be at any given time. Spanning sync brings these two calendars together seamlessly. My only problem now is remembering to sync my iPod to my computer. If there was a way to do this wirelessly I&#8217;d be set.</p>
<p>Anyone else have any techniques/apps they?d like to share?</p>

It stores, backs things up and syncs your files just as quick as if you were working directly on your computer.  You can also create public folders online where people can go to access the files you want to share.</p>
<p>What this app allows me to do is sync things between my work and home computers. For example, my 1password keychain is located in my Dropbox so that I have access to all my passwords on both computers <a href="http://webworkerdaily.com/2008/09/29/1password-dropbox-sync/" target="_blank">[here's how]</a>. When I am working on a site on MAMP, I can use a folder in my Dropbox as the root directory allowing me to work on the same design from both computers. And because it is all stored online I don&#8217;t need to keep my computer at work on to access these files.</p>
<p><strong>Spanning Sync</strong> <a href="http://spanningsync.com/" target="_blank">[website]</a><br />
<a href="http://spanningsync.com/" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-90" title="spanning-sync" src="http://eimaj.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/spanning-sync.png" alt="" style="float:left;  padding:6px; margin-top:10px;" width="32" height="32" /></a>This app syncs my calendars. This is by far the most useful app I use, because it reminds me of where I need to be and when. At work we use Google Calendars to set up meetings and see when co-workers are free. I use iCal and my iPod to keep track of where I am supposed to be at any given time. Spanning sync brings these two calendars together seamlessly. My only problem now is remembering to sync my iPod to my computer. If there was a way to do this wirelessly I&#8217;d be set.</p>
<p>Anyone else have any techniques/apps they?d like to share?</p>
