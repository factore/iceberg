<p>Scribus is an open source desktop publishing application, and it&#8217;s available for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. I don&#8217;t reach for it whenever I need to produce a basic looking document, but for logos, booklets, brochures, or just very eye-popping pages I do.</p>
<p>In Scribus, you&#8217;ll find most of the professional features you find in products such as InDesign. You get flexible PDF creation features, ICC color management and CMYK color, and more. You can get a good sense of what the application can do by touring this <a href="http://www.scribus.net/?q=image/tid/26">collection</a> of screenshots. In true open source fashion, you can also find many useful links to <a href="http://www.scribus.net/?q=links">add-ons and enhancements</a> on Scribus&#8217; site. These include printing enhancement tools, color management extras, and more.</p>
<p>There are quite a few publishing houses that rely on Scribus, such as <a href="http://www.scribus.net/?q=news/20080505_newscribuspubhouse">Urco Editora</a>. You can find more on this application, and several other open source tools for creating documents in <a href="http://ostatic.com/167227-blog/6-free-tools-for-creating-top-notch-documents ">today&#8217;s post</a> on OStatic.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.getpaint.net/">Paint.net</a> is a very popular free image and graphics editing program. Jeff Atwood at Coding Horror has <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000993.html">raved about it</a> before. One of its best features is that you can apply effects and filters and then undo them as many times as you like.</p>
<p>In response to a recent post I did, readers wrote in about <a href="http://mobaphoto.mobatek.net/en/">Mobaphoto</a>. I haven&#8217;t had a chance to try this yet, but from the looks of it it caters well to the image editing needs of digital photographers. It lets you make corrections to photos in batches, and more.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.irfanview.com/">IrfanView</a>, as I&#8217;ve mentioned <a href="http://webworkerdaily.com/2008/06/30/four-free-slick-mini-apps/">before</a>, is my very favorite free image editing program. It&#8217;s very fast to get in and out of, and is one of the most popular pieces of freeware out there.</p>
<p>No matter what kind of web worker you are, if you work with graphics, you probably frequently work with JPG images. <a href="http://www.rainbow-software.org/programs.html#JPG%20Cleaner">JPG Cleaner</a> is a slick little program for taking artifacts out of JPG images.</p>
<p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010424021827/http://www.iconico.com/caliper/">Screen Calipers</a> is a handy little utility for measuring inside and outside of objects in graphics. You can access exact pixel distances, crop pictures to perfection, and more with it.</p>
<p><em>Do you have any favorite graphics tools?</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.irfanview.com/">IrfanView</a>, as I&#8217;ve mentioned <a href="http://webworkerdaily.com/2008/06/30/four-free-slick-mini-apps/">before</a>, is my very favorite free image editing program. It&#8217;s very fast to get in and out of, and is one of the most popular pieces of freeware out there.</p>
<p>No matter what kind of web worker you are, if you work with graphics, you probably frequently work with JPG images. <a href="http://www.rainbow-software.org/programs.html#JPG%20Cleaner">JPG Cleaner</a> is a slick little program for taking artifacts out of JPG images.</p>
<p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010424021827/http://www.iconico.com/caliper/">Screen Calipers</a> is a handy little utility for measuring inside and outside of objects in graphics. You can access exact pixel distances, crop pictures to perfection, and more with it.</p>
<p><em>Do you have any favorite graphics tools?</em></p>

<li>40 percent said they use their cell phones for traffic, weather, and stock market alerts</li>

<p>What is important though is that 88 percent said that it is very important to have a cell phone to use in case of emergency.</p>
<p>I have to admit that I am not too familiar with my cell phone&#8217;s functions. I use it simply to call and send text messages. Of course, this was until yesterday when I received a note from T-Mobile informing me that text messaging rate will increase from $0.15 cents to $0.20 cents effective August 29, 2008.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.techsmith.com/screen-capture.asp">SnagIt</a> is one of the best screen capture programs I?ve ever used. It?s especially popular with bloggers, as it integrates with all the top blogging applications very well. What a lot of people don&#8217;t realize is that SnagIt can also capture video segments very easily and flexibly. This is a great way to save online video content to, say, DVDs. There?s a free trial for SnagIt, but you do need to pay $49.95 if you like the application.</p>
<p>You wouldn&#8217;t normally think of content in PowerPoint presentations as desirable content to put in video format, but many presentations are now very visually rich, complete with animation and the like. If you want to convert PowerPoint content to Flash format, check out <a href="http://www.ispringsolutions.com/products/ispring_free.html">iSpring</a>. It&#8217;s a free download and gives you an interesting way to deliver presentation content in video format.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a Mac user and like to use an iSight camera to record videos and load them on YouTube, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/vidnik/">Vidnik</a> is the app for you. The application is specifically tuned for sending your video to YouTube for encoding and posting. It was developed as part of Google&#8217;s <a href="http://code.google.com/mac/">Mac Developer Playground</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.celtx.com/overview.html">Celtx</a> is open source media pre-production software that goes way beyond just helping you generate scripts. You can do storyboards, develop characters, and more. If you&#8217;re interested in developing long-form video content, I recommend taking the <a href="http://www.celtx.com/walkthru/">Feature Tour</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.techsmith.com/screen-capture.asp">SnagIt</a> is one of the best screen capture programs I?ve ever used. It?s especially popular with bloggers, as it integrates with all the top blogging applications very well. What a lot of people don&#8217;t realize is that SnagIt can also capture video segments very easily and flexibly. This is a great way to save online video content to, say, DVDs. There?s a free trial for SnagIt, but you do need to pay $49.95 if you like the application.</p>
<p>You wouldn&#8217;t normally think of content in PowerPoint presentations as desirable content to put in video format, but many presentations are now very visually rich, complete with animation and the like. If you want to convert PowerPoint content to Flash format, check out <a href="http://www.ispringsolutions.com/products/ispring_free.html">iSpring</a>. It&#8217;s a free download and gives you an interesting way to deliver presentation content in video format.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a Mac user and like to use an iSight camera to record videos and load them on YouTube, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/vidnik/">Vidnik</a> is the app for you. The application is specifically tuned for sending your video to YouTube for encoding and posting. It was developed as part of Google&#8217;s <a href="http://code.google.com/mac/">Mac Developer Playground</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.celtx.com/overview.html">Celtx</a> is open source media pre-production software that goes way beyond just helping you generate scripts. You can do storyboards, develop characters, and more. If you&#8217;re interested in developing long-form video content, I recommend taking the <a href="http://www.celtx.com/walkthru/">Feature Tour</a>.</p>
