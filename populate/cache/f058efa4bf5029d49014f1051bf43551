<br />Ford has managed to eke out an extra 2 miles per gallon on the highway from the heavily revised <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/2010ShelbyGt500/">2010 Shelby GT500</a>, bringing its EPA estimated figures to 14 mpg city and 22 mpg highway. Sure, it seems rather unlikely that buyers considering a muscle car will be all that concerned with fuel economy, but we'll take what we can get, especially since the fuel economy increase is accompanied by a bump up to 540 horsepower and a stump-pulling 510 lb-ft of torque. Plus, an increase in highway mileage means fewer stops on long trips, and that's always welcome in our book.<br /><br />Now, all of this is fine and dandy, but we all know the real reason this car exists is to obliterate its tires on every 4.3-second blast to 60 mph. Fortunately for fans of ridiculous straight-line acceleration, the revisions that make the latest Shelby more fuel efficient also also end up contributing to its ability to accelerate. The biggest change that helps on the highway is numerically lower gearing in the transmission for the fifth and sixth cogs, which, combined with a 3.55:1 axle ratio, allows the baddest 'Stang to boast improved acceleration in the first four gears to go along with the lowered RPM highway drone made possible by the last two gears.<br /><br />Ford also points to a refined air intake and a revised twin-disc clutch as reasons that the 2010 Shelby GT500 is a step above its predecessor, and we also took note of the vastly superior interior that's standard in all new Mustangs when we last looked at the GT500. <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2009/01/01/detroit-preview-2010-ford-shelby-gt500-bites-back/">Click here</a> to read all about it, and click past the break for the mpg-touting press release.<br /><br /><br /><div class="postgallery"><p><strong>Gallery: <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/photos/detroit-2009-2010-shelby-gt500-live/">Detroit 2009: 2010 Shelby GT500 Live</a></strong></p><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/photos/detroit-2009-2010-shelby-gt500-live/1281531/"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.autoblog.com/media/2009/01/001_gt500detroit_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title="" /></a><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/photos/detroit-2009-2010-shelby-gt500-live/1281532/"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.autoblog.com/media/2009/01/002_gt500detroit_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title="" /></a><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/photos/detroit-2009-2010-shelby-gt500-live/1281533/"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.autoblog.com/media/2009/01/003_gt500detroit_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title="" /></a><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/photos/detroit-2009-2010-shelby-gt500-live/1281534/"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.autoblog.com/media/2009/01/004_gt500detroit_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title="" /></a><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/photos/detroit-2009-2010-shelby-gt500-live/1281535/"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.autoblog.com/media/2009/01/005_gt500detroit_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title="" /></a></div><br />[Source: Ford]<p><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2009/04/01/2010-ford-shelby-gt500-squeezes-out-an-extra-2-mpg/" rel="bookmark">Continue reading <em>2010 Ford Shelby GT500 squeezes out an extra 2 MPG</em></a></p><p style="padding:5px;background:#ddd;border:1px solid #ccc;clear:both;"><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2009/04/01/2010-ford-shelby-gt500-squeezes-out-an-extra-2-mpg/">2010 Ford Shelby GT500 squeezes out an extra 2 MPG</a> originally appeared on <a href="http://www.autoblog.com">Autoblog</a> on Wed, 01 Apr 2009 08:59:00 EST.

The Fiesta ST reportedly has a chance of being revived in 2012, but until then, it's apparently standard models for everyone.<br /><br />[Source: <em>EVO Magazine</em> via <a href="http://www.4wheelsnews.com/ford-cancels-the-fiesta-rs/">4 Wheels News</a>]<p style="padding:5px;background:#ddd;border:1px solid #ccc;clear:both;"><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2009/03/31/ford-reportedly-turning-its-back-on-production-fiesta-rs/">Ford reportedly turning its back on production Fiesta RS</a> originally appeared on <a href="http://www.autoblog.com">Autoblog</a> on Tue, 31 Mar 2009 18:40:00 EST.

<div align="center"><em><strong><small>Ford Explorer America Concept - Click above for high-res image gallery</small></strong></em><br /></div>
<br />At the 2008 <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/category/Detroit-Auto-Show/">Detroit Auto Show</a>, Ford unveiled the <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2008/01/06/detroit-2008-ford-explorer-america-concept-says-bye-bye-to-body/">Explorer America</a> concept. It was a car-based crossover concept that, in theory, would improve efficiency versus the once popular body-on-frame Explorer SUV. According to union officials at Ford's Chicago plant, the next Explorer will be produced at the Torrence Avenue assembly plant in 2011. Union officials claim that Ford promised the Explorer to Chicago as part of the recently reworked UAW contract. <br /><br />The <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2008/10/23/spy-shots-next-gen-unibody-ford-explorer-mules-caught/">next Explorer</a> will reportedly be built on the outgoing Taurus X platform, which also underpins the Ford Flex, Taurus and the Lincoln MKS and MKT. The Flex, MKS and MKT are all built at Ford's Oakville, Ontario plant, while the pending cancellation of the Taurus X and Mercury Sable left the recently overhauled Chicago plant twisting in the wind. Ford has not officially confirmed that it will build the Explorer at Chicago, but the Blue Oval did say that a new product would be assembled at the plant.<br /><br />Ford is expected to unveil the new Explorer crossover with efficient new Ecoboost engines that utilize turbochargers and direct injection to offer large powertrain power with the fuel economy of a smaller engine. The Explorer America concept featured a turbocharged 2.0L Ecoboost four-cylinder engine producing 275 hp and 280 lb-ft or a 340-hp Ecoboost 3.5-liter V6 with fuel savings of up to 30% versus the current Explorer.<br /><br /><br /><div class="postgallery"><p><strong>Gallery: <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/photos/detroit-2008-ford-explorer-america-concept/">Detroit 2008: Ford Explorer America concept</a></strong></p><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/photos/detroit-2008-ford-explorer-america-concept/559728/"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.autoblog.com/media/2008/01/exploreramercon_45_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title="" /></a><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/photos/detroit-2008-ford-explorer-america-concept/559693/"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.autoblog.com/media/2008/01/exploreramercon_48_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title="" /></a><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/photos/detroit-2008-ford-explorer-america-concept/559704/"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.autoblog.com/media/2008/01/exploreramercon_49_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title="" /></a><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/photos/detroit-2008-ford-explorer-america-concept/559690/"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.autoblog.com/media/2008/01/exploreramercon_50_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title="" /></a><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/photos/detroit-2008-ford-explorer-america-concept/559726/"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.autoblog.com/media/2008/01/exploreramercon_01_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title="" /></a></div><br />[Source: <a href="http://www.chicagobreakingnews.com/2009/03/fords-chicago-plant-set-to-make-new-vehicle.html">Chicago Breaking News</a> via <a href="http://jalopnik.com/5190286/2011-ford-explorer-to-be-built-in-chicago-taurus-x+based">Jalopnik</a>]<p style="padding:5px;background:#ddd;border:1px solid #ccc;clear:both;"><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2009/03/31/2011-ford-explorer-reportedly-to-be-built-in-chicago-on-taurus-x/">2011 Ford Explorer reportedly to be built in Chicago on Taurus X platform</a> originally appeared on <a href="http://www.autoblog.com">Autoblog</a> on Tue, 31 Mar 2009 08:59:00 EST.

<div align="center"><em><strong><small>Ford Explorer America Concept - Click above for high-res image gallery</small></strong></em><br /></div>
<br />At the 2008 <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/category/Detroit-Auto-Show/">Detroit Auto Show</a>, Ford unveiled the <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2008/01/06/detroit-2008-ford-explorer-america-concept-says-bye-bye-to-body/">Explorer America</a> concept. It was a car-based crossover concept that, in theory, would improve efficiency versus the once popular body-on-frame Explorer SUV. According to union officials at Ford's Chicago plant, the next Explorer will be produced at the Torrence Avenue assembly plant in 2011. Union officials claim that Ford promised the Explorer to Chicago as part of the recently reworked UAW contract. <br /><br />The <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2008/10/23/spy-shots-next-gen-unibody-ford-explorer-mules-caught/">next Explorer</a> will reportedly be built on the outgoing Taurus X platform, which also underpins the Ford Flex, Taurus and the Lincoln MKS and MKT. The Flex, MKS and MKT are all built at Ford's Oakville, Ontario plant, while the pending cancellation of the Taurus X and Mercury Sable left the recently overhauled Chicago plant twisting in the wind. Ford has not officially confirmed that it will build the Explorer at Chicago, but the Blue Oval did say that a new product would be assembled at the plant.<br /><br />Ford is expected to unveil the new Explorer crossover with efficient new Ecoboost engines that utilize turbochargers and direct injection to offer large powertrain power with the fuel economy of a smaller engine. The Explorer America concept featured a turbocharged 2.0L Ecoboost four-cylinder engine producing 275 hp and 280 lb-ft or a 340-hp Ecoboost 3.5-liter V6 with fuel savings of up to 30% versus the current Explorer.<br /><br /><br /><div class="postgallery"><p><strong>Gallery: <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/photos/detroit-2008-ford-explorer-america-concept/">Detroit 2008: Ford Explorer America concept</a></strong></p><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/photos/detroit-2008-ford-explorer-america-concept/559728/"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.autoblog.com/media/2008/01/exploreramercon_45_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title="" /></a><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/photos/detroit-2008-ford-explorer-america-concept/559693/"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.autoblog.com/media/2008/01/exploreramercon_48_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title="" /></a><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/photos/detroit-2008-ford-explorer-america-concept/559704/"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.autoblog.com/media/2008/01/exploreramercon_49_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title="" /></a><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/photos/detroit-2008-ford-explorer-america-concept/559690/"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.autoblog.com/media/2008/01/exploreramercon_50_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title="" /></a><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/photos/detroit-2008-ford-explorer-america-concept/559726/"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.autoblog.com/media/2008/01/exploreramercon_01_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title="" /></a></div><br />[Source: <a href="http://www.chicagobreakingnews.com/2009/03/fords-chicago-plant-set-to-make-new-vehicle.html">Chicago Breaking News</a> via <a href="http://jalopnik.com/5190286/2011-ford-explorer-to-be-built-in-chicago-taurus-x+based">Jalopnik</a>]<p style="padding:5px;background:#ddd;border:1px solid #ccc;clear:both;"><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2009/03/31/2011-ford-explorer-reportedly-to-be-built-in-chicago-on-taurus-x/">2011 Ford Explorer reportedly to be built in Chicago on Taurus X platform</a> originally appeared on <a href="http://www.autoblog.com">Autoblog</a> on Tue, 31 Mar 2009 08:59:00 EST.

</small> <br />While visiting our favorite weekly car gathering in SoCal today, we were stopped in our tracks when we spotted "Everybody Loves Raymond" star Ray Romano, happily answering questions about the shiny new <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/ford+fiesta/">Ford Fiesta</a> parked beside him. We thought it odd for Ford to enlist such a well-known stand-up comic to pitch the product at such a meager gathering, but figured even A-list talent might be hurting for a little extra scratch in this economic climate. We approached to get a better look and realized it was actually Fiesta Brand Manager Sam De La Garza a dead ringer for the actor who portrayed everybody's favorite Italian-American non-mobster on television.<br /><br />Sam brought the Fiesta to Cars &amp; Coffee to show it off and elicit some reactions. He also wanted to remind folks that the <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/fiesta+movement/">Fiesta Movement</a> is still underway, although he declined comment on sister site <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2009/03/24/video-autobloggreen-tries-out-for-the-fiesta-movement/">AB Green's entry</a>. Without giving too much away, he did mention that the response to the contest has been overwhelming. He told us that the entries have been beyond imagination, mentioning, for example, that Juston Laipply, creator of the &uuml;ber-viral "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMH0bHeiRNg">Evolution of Dance</a>", was among the entrants. While the Fiesta's success in America seems to be a foregone conclusion in some camps, Sam also brought along a <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2008/11/03/ford-ceo-wants-to-bring-ka-to-u-s/">Ford Ka</a> to see whether the Fiesta might have big enough coattails to carry its kid brother as well.

<div align="center"><em><strong><small>2010 Ford Focus RS - Click above for high-res image gallery</small></strong></em><br /><em><strong></strong></em></div>
<em><strong><small><br /></small></strong></em>Pretty soon, it seems like the start of N&uuml;rburgring lap time season will take its place on motorsports calendars the same way you find with Formula 1 and NASCAR. The 'Ring season <a href="http://www.imotormag.co.uk/news/223453/ford_focus_rs_hits_the_nrburgring_preparing_for_lap_record_attempt.html">officially began last week</a>, and the title card pitted the 2009 Ford Focus RS against the <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2008/07/22/london-2008-renaultsport-megane-r26-r/">Renaultsport Megane R26.R</a>. The Ford's numbers are 297 hp and 324 lb-ft; the Renault posts 230 hp and 229 lb.-ft, and the Megane's time <a href="http://www.metacafe.com/watch/1581654/renault_megane_r26r/">stands at 8:16.9</a> (not 8:12) on its Toyo track-friendly rubber. <br /><br />For the first round, the detuned 250 hp Focus RS test car managed 8:27 on "standard Continental tires," so Ford is reportedly looking at the full-fat 297 hp car to do around 8:15. Word is if they can get that close, they'll consider adding the Toyo Cup tires to the customer options list, which could subtract at least three seconds from the Focus' time and allow it to take home the 'Ring trophy for hot hatches. Ford will be back at the 'Ring next week to give it a go. Cheating? Perhaps. Pointless? Maybe. Fun for us to watch? Definitely. <em>Hat tip to yaroukh</em><br /><br /><br /><div class="postgallery"><p><strong>Gallery: <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/photos/2009-focus-rs-in-blue/">2009 Ford Focus RS</a></strong></p><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/photos/2009-focus-rs-in-blue/1214356/"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.autoblog.com/media/2008/12/00_focusrsblue_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title="" /></a><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/photos/2009-focus-rs-in-blue/1214350/"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.autoblog.com/media/2008/12/01_focusrsblue_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title="" /></a><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/photos/2009-focus-rs-in-blue/1214352/"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.autoblog.com/media/2008/12/02_focusrsblue_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title="" /></a><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/photos/2009-focus-rs-in-blue/1214338/"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.autoblog.com/media/2008/12/03_focusrsblue_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title="" /></a><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/photos/2009-focus-rs-in-blue/1214348/"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.autoblog.com/media/2008/12/04_focusrsblue_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title="" /></a></div><br /><div class="postgallery"><p><strong>Gallery: <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/photos/renaultsport-megane-r26-r/">Renaultsport Megane R26.R</a></strong></p><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/photos/renaultsport-megane-r26-r/940102/"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.autoblog.com/media/2008/07/01_renaultsport_r26r_press_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title="" /></a><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/photos/renaultsport-megane-r26-r/940113/"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.autoblog.com/media/2008/07/02_renaultsport_r26r_press_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title="" /></a><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/photos/renaultsport-megane-r26-r/940115/"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.autoblog.com/media/2008/07/03_renaultsport_r26r_press_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title="" /></a><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/photos/renaultsport-megane-r26-r/940104/"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.autoblog.com/media/2008/07/04_renaultsport_r26r_press_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title="" /></a><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/photos/renaultsport-megane-r26-r/940105/"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.autoblog.com/media/2008/07/05_renaultsport_r26r_press_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title="" /></a></div><br />[Source: <a href="http://drivingspirit.com/2008/07/renault/focus-rs-showdown-with-megane-r26-r-at-nurburgring/">Driving Spirit</a>]<p style="padding:5px;background:#ddd;border:1px solid #ccc;clear:both;"><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2009/03/26/ford-focus-rs-heads-to-ring-in-search-of-a-class-record/">Ford Focus RS heads to 'Ring in search of a class record</a> originally appeared on <a href="http://www.autoblog.com">Autoblog</a> on Thu, 26 Mar 2009 13:32:00 EST.

<div align="center"><em><strong><small>2010 Ford Focus RS - Click above for high-res image gallery</small></strong></em><br /><em><strong></strong></em></div>
<em><strong><small><br /></small></strong></em>Pretty soon, it seems like the start of N&uuml;rburgring lap time season will take its place on motorsports calendars the same way you find with Formula 1 and NASCAR. The 'Ring season <a href="http://www.imotormag.co.uk/news/223453/ford_focus_rs_hits_the_nrburgring_preparing_for_lap_record_attempt.html">officially began last week</a>, and the title card pitted the 2009 Ford Focus RS against the <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2008/07/22/london-2008-renaultsport-megane-r26-r/">Renaultsport Megane R26.R</a>. The Ford's numbers are 297 hp and 324 lb-ft; the Renault posts 230 hp and 229 lb.-ft, and the Megane's time <a href="http://www.metacafe.com/watch/1581654/renault_megane_r26r/">stands at 8:16.9</a> (not 8:12) on its Toyo track-friendly rubber. <br /><br />For the first round, the detuned 250 hp Focus RS test car managed 8:27 on "standard Continental tires," so Ford is reportedly looking at the full-fat 297 hp car to do around 8:15. Word is if they can get that close, they'll consider adding the Toyo Cup tires to the customer options list, which could subtract at least three seconds from the Focus' time and allow it to take home the 'Ring trophy for hot hatches. Ford will be back at the 'Ring next week to give it a go. Cheating? Perhaps. Pointless? Maybe. Fun for us to watch? Definitely. <em>Hat tip to yaroukh</em><br /><br /><br /><div class="postgallery"><p><strong>Gallery: <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/photos/2009-focus-rs-in-blue/">2009 Ford Focus RS</a></strong></p><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/photos/2009-focus-rs-in-blue/1214356/"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.autoblog.com/media/2008/12/00_focusrsblue_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title="" /></a><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/photos/2009-focus-rs-in-blue/1214350/"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.autoblog.com/media/2008/12/01_focusrsblue_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title="" /></a><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/photos/2009-focus-rs-in-blue/1214352/"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.autoblog.com/media/2008/12/02_focusrsblue_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title="" /></a><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/photos/2009-focus-rs-in-blue/1214338/"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.autoblog.com/media/2008/12/03_focusrsblue_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title="" /></a><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/photos/2009-focus-rs-in-blue/1214348/"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.autoblog.com/media/2008/12/04_focusrsblue_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title="" /></a></div><br /><div class="postgallery"><p><strong>Gallery: <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/photos/renaultsport-megane-r26-r/">Renaultsport Megane R26.R</a></strong></p><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/photos/renaultsport-megane-r26-r/940102/"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.autoblog.com/media/2008/07/01_renaultsport_r26r_press_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title="" /></a><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/photos/renaultsport-megane-r26-r/940113/"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.autoblog.com/media/2008/07/02_renaultsport_r26r_press_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title="" /></a><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/photos/renaultsport-megane-r26-r/940115/"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.autoblog.com/media/2008/07/03_renaultsport_r26r_press_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title="" /></a><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/photos/renaultsport-megane-r26-r/940104/"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.autoblog.com/media/2008/07/04_renaultsport_r26r_press_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title="" /></a><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/photos/renaultsport-megane-r26-r/940105/"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.autoblog.com/media/2008/07/05_renaultsport_r26r_press_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title="" /></a></div><br />[Source: <a href="http://drivingspirit.com/2008/07/renault/focus-rs-showdown-with-megane-r26-r-at-nurburgring/">Driving Spirit</a>]<p style="padding:5px;background:#ddd;border:1px solid #ccc;clear:both;"><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2009/03/26/ford-focus-rs-heads-to-ring-in-search-of-a-class-record/">Ford Focus RS heads to 'Ring in search of a class record</a> originally appeared on <a href="http://www.autoblog.com">Autoblog</a> on Thu, 26 Mar 2009 13:32:00 EST.

By comparison, General Motors' CEO Rick Wagoner and Chrysler's Bob Nardelli are slated to have salaries of $1 each, although both automakers have already received $17.4 billion in federal loans.<br /><br />In addition,<em> Automotive News </em>reports that the company will abolish merit raises for salaried workers in the U.S. (and in most of its global ops), kill off a worldwide incentive compensation program for 2008 and newer employees, and give no compensation to board members for 2009.<br /><br />In related news that's causing a bit of consternation, AN is reporting that Mulally and executive chairman Bill Ford <a href="http://www.autonews.com/article/20090325/ANA02/903249965/1200">will continue to use corporate jets</a> for business and private travel.

By comparison, General Motors' CEO Rick Wagoner and Chrysler's Bob Nardelli are slated to have salaries of $1 each, although both automakers have already received $17.4 billion in federal loans.<br /><br />In addition,<em> Automotive News </em>reports that the company will abolish merit raises for salaried workers in the U.S. (and in most of its global ops), kill off a worldwide incentive compensation program for 2008 and newer employees, and give no compensation to board members for 2009.<br /><br />In related news that's causing a bit of consternation, AN is reporting that Mulally and executive chairman Bill Ford <a href="http://www.autonews.com/article/20090325/ANA02/903249965/1200">will continue to use corporate jets</a> for business and private travel.

<br />If you're the type of person who loves every new Ford Mustang variation that hits the market, then this is what you've finally been waiting for. If you're the type who can't stand it, well, deal with it. Today, Roush is the first to dip its toe into into what will doubtlessly be a very crowded pool of tuner Mustangs with the introduction of its 2010 427R Mustang at its Livonia, MI assembly plant. <br /><br />Like the standard 2010 Mustang, don't expect drastic changes underneath - the meat-and-potatoes of Roush Mustangs over the past few years are all there but now with a fresh new face. Under the hood, the Blue Oval's V8 has been supercharged to produce 435 horsepower and 400 lb-ft of torque, and it now features a more efficient intake system and improved cooling. <br /><br />The appearance package is relatively subtle (if you can call side stripes "subtle") and includes a new front fascia, front splitter, rear fascia, side sills, a three-piece rear wing and 18-inch wheels (20-inchers are optional). Roush has also spent countless hours tuning the suspension system, which consists of new springs, shocks and sway bars, although we can't imagine Ford's own setup being improved upon too much. Roush will have to send us a 427R to test so can find out for ourselves.<br /><br /> Finally, all the little details that come with a limited edition production car are all there - fender badges, rear decklid emblem, aluminum pedals, embroidered floor mats and a serialized engine bay plaque. In addition to the standard features, customers can also choose from numerous upgrades including reupholstered leather seats, short-throw shifter, performance exhaust, and more. More details after the jump, and a low-res gallery is below (we hope to update with more higher-quality images as soon as they become available).<br /><br /><br /><div class="postgallery"><p><strong>Gallery: <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/photos/2010-roush-427r-mustang/">2010 Roush 427R Mustang</a></strong></p><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/photos/2010-roush-427r-mustang/1438640/"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.autoblog.com/media/2009/03/roush2010_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title="" /></a><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/photos/2010-roush-427r-mustang/1438639/"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.autoblog.com/media/2009/03/roush2010conv_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title="" /></a><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/photos/2010-roush-427r-mustang/1438505/"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.autoblog.com/media/2009/03/2010roush427r_01_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title="" /></a><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/photos/2010-roush-427r-mustang/1438506/"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.autoblog.com/media/2009/03/2010roush427r_02_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title="" /></a><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/photos/2010-roush-427r-mustang/1438507/"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.autoblog.com/media/2009/03/2010roush427r_03_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title="" /></a></div><br />[Source: Roush]<p><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2009/03/18/first-to-the-punch-roush-unveils-2010-427r-mustang/" rel="bookmark">Continue reading <em>First to the Punch: Roush unveils 2010 427R Mustang</em></a></p><p style="padding:5px;background:#ddd;border:1px solid #ccc;clear:both;"><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2009/03/18/first-to-the-punch-roush-unveils-2010-427r-mustang/">First to the Punch: Roush unveils 2010 427R Mustang</a> originally appeared on <a href="http://www.autoblog.com">Autoblog</a> on Wed, 18 Mar 2009 11:28:00 EST.

<br />Ohio Congresswoman Betty Sutton has introduced a new bill to provide a voucher of up to $5,000 in exchange for your clunker. To be eligible for the voucher, car buyers would have to purchase a new vehicle that is more fuel efficient than the car or truck it replaces. The trade-in also needs to be at least eight years old, while the replacement vehicle needs to sticker for less than $35,000. <br /><br />The bill will include purchases of both foreign and domestic autos, but there is an incentive to buy vehicles assembled in North America. If the bill passes, foreign-made vehicles will receive a voucher of $4,000, while North American-made vehicles will be eligible for the entire $5,000.<br /><br />Sutton is hailing her bill as a win for all, saying the legislation will "help consumers, stimulate our economy, improve our environment, reduce our dependence on foreign oil, and help our domestic auto and related industries." Not surprisingly, domestic automakers are smitten with the idea of vehicle vouchers. General Motors CEO Rick Wagoner said the legislation would be a "big help," while Ford called the idea a "win-win" for the auto industry and the environment.

<br />Being a Clevelander, I had already heard about what's going on at the site of Ford's former Lorain Assembly plant. At one time it was producing more than 10,000 vans and SUVs per month, but that number dwindled until eventually the plant was shuttered in 2005 and the property sold to the California-based Industrial Realty Group. We've heard the facility has since been rented out to a number of companies and we've even seen advanced driving courses being hosted on its expansive and now weed-ridden parking lot.<br /><br />While slow sales once led to the Lorain plant's demise, the same situation today has given it a new purpose. Honda, which operates a number of plants in Ohio and takes full advantage of the state's existing network of rail lines, is renting the plant's parking lot to store up to 10,000 units of unsold inventory. The Japanese automaker, itself not used to having an overabundance of unsold vehicles on hand, has taken over the giant parking lot with a sea of Civics built in Ohio and Ontario, Acura MDX crossovers from Canada and Odyssey minivans from Alabama. <br /><br />We've heard plenty of news reports about ports on each coast overflowing with unsold vehicles, but this is the first we've heard of a plant formerly owned and operated by a domestic being repurposed by an import automaker just for the use of storage. It's a sign of the times that companies are using creative solutions to get by, and this one ranks right up there.<br /><br />[Source: <a href="http://blog.cleveland.com/business/2009/03/honda_storing_unsold_cars_at_f.html">Blog.Cleveland.com</a> | Photo by Marvin Fong / <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/plaindealer/">The Plain Dealer</a>]<p style="padding:5px;background:#ddd;border:1px solid #ccc;clear:both;"><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2009/03/16/former-ford-plant-home-to-thousands-of-unsold-hondas/">Former Ford plant home to thousands of unsold Hondas</a> originally appeared on <a href="http://www.autoblog.com">Autoblog</a> on Mon, 16 Mar 2009 18:28:00 EST.
