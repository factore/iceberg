There will be a three-way battle between two of his assistants and the president of one of the largest Canadian Auto Workers locals in the country.</p>

<p>Ken Lewenza, president of <span class="caps">CAW</span> Local 444 in Windsor, Ontario, made his entry into the campaign after winning the endorsement of the presidents of union locals in Windsor and nearby Essex and Kent counties.</p>

<p>He will join Hemi Mitic, an assistant to Mr. Hargrove who was a key negotiator in the union's breakthrough deal with auto parts giant Magna International Inc. and Tom Collins, a former head of the Canadian unit of the Retail Wholesale and Department Store Union, who said yesterday he will also throw his hat in the ring.</p>

<p>After being President of the union for 16 years, Hargrove will reach the mandatory retirement age of 65 and depart next March.</p>
