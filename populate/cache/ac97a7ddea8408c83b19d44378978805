<p>I thought the 2008 Honda Accord sedan would be a good car to take home over the long Fourth of July holiday weekend. Not too big, not too small--it should work out just fine for any trip we might decide to take.</p>
<p>Within 5 minutes of leaving the office, however, I knew we weren't going anywhere. Pitch the tent in the back yard, kids: we're going to have a "staycation" at home.</p>
<p>Those leather seats might look inviting, but they're as hard as a rock--or so said my buttometer. The cushion had no give, the seams clawed at the pockets of my jeans, and no amount of adjustment would make it go away. I couldn't get out fast enough.</p>

<p>
<p>Without saying anything to my wife, we went to dinner. She's 8 inches shorter than me; maybe these seats are better-suited to those of&nbsp; shorter stature. </p>
<p>No such luck. Before she even buckled her belt she was fishing for a non-existent lumbar adjustment (only the driver gets one) to relieve what she termed,&nbsp;"the basketball in my back."</p>
<p>Based on this, I'd have to pass on&nbsp;the leather.&nbsp;The cloth seats are liable to lack the drum-tight surface tension of these leather ones, resulting in more cush for the tush. Sucks that the front&nbsp;passenger doesn't get a lumbar adjustment, though. Last time I checked, all of the folks who've ridden shotgun with me had a spine. It's practically a prerequisite.</p>

<p>Without saying anything to my wife, we went to dinner. She's 8 inches shorter than me; maybe these seats are better-suited to those of&nbsp; shorter stature. </p>
<p>No such luck. Before she even buckled her belt she was fishing for a non-existent lumbar adjustment (only the driver gets one) to relieve what she termed,&nbsp;"the basketball in my back."</p>
<p>Based on this, I'd have to pass on&nbsp;the leather.&nbsp;The cloth seats are liable to lack the drum-tight surface tension of these leather ones, resulting in more cush for the tush. Sucks that the front&nbsp;passenger doesn't get a lumbar adjustment, though. Last time I checked, all of the folks who've ridden shotgun with me had a spine. It's practically a prerequisite.</p>

<p>Sure our 2008 BMW X5 is a city dweller, and sure it's probably more suited to the racetrack (we did order the sport package) than the unpaved road, but what the heck, lets go off roading. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Okay, so it's not exactly the Rubicon, but a good hour of this deep silt had our X5 workin'. To keep moving we had the stability control system off and the truck's big 4.8-liter V8 near the top of the tach. Never got stuck, though, and the truck's all-wheel drive system never tried to eat itself or lock up in befuddlement. </p>
<p>We also have high praise for the Beamer's air conditioning, expecially its recirculation feature&nbsp;which kept the dust and the 105 degree desert heat on the truck's outside. </p>
<p>Tune tomorrow when I actually try to put a full grown human being in the X5's third row seat.</p>

<p>There's a lot that I like about our Hyundai Veracruz. We could start with its ride quality. The SUV feels luxurious on the road, with a suspension tuned to make bumps, ruts and other road irregularities disappear like they were part of a Houdini magic trick. The going is soft but not too soft; there's enough road feel to keep it from feeling like a cruiser for the geriatric set.</p>
<p>In fact, the Veracruz's universal attention to luxury had me thinking of another favorite SUV of mine, our Buick Enclave. Both are similarly impressive in their competence, but there's one big difference that separates them: price. A base Veracruz goes for $29,900, while a base Enclave will set you back $33,220.</p>

<p>The only thing worse than 2,000 miles of road grime is 2,000 miles of road grime on non-waxed paint. As such, I spent about six hours yesterday washing and waxing the Ford GT's paint in prep for its journey though the Rocky Mountains. To do the job correctly you can't just wash it and dry it off, and you can't even just add a coat of wax. No, to do it right you much strip all the old/existing wax off and start from scratch.</p>
<p>So the first step was washing the car to remove all existing dirt and grime from the paint. The GT was still pretty clean from the last washing so this was relatively quick and easy.</p>

The forward clutch <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprag">sprag</a> was replaced -- they did not, as some commenters had assumed, replaced the transmission with a refurbished unit -- and the transmission was, again, reconditioned. Two days to tear into a transmission and have it back in our hands? Not bad. But if they have, in fact, had "a rash" of these, it may have saved a lot of time in diagnosis and parts availability. There is also a TSB out on this issue, <a href="http://www.edmunds.com/maintenance/recalltsb.do?step=tsb&amp;year=2007&amp;make=Chevrolet&amp;model=Silverado+1500&amp;style=LT1+4dr+Extended+Cab+4WD+8+ft.+LB+%285.3L+8cyl+4A%29&amp;zip=90036&amp;synpartner=edmunds#92"><font class="bodytext">NHTSA ITEM NUMBER - 10021018</font>.</a><br /><br />The good news: Drive works and the transmission is again able to use all gears.<br /><br />The bad news: The transmission doesn't shift any smoother than it did before the sprag failure. <br /><br />Days out of service: 3<br />Cost to us: $0.00 <br /><br />Mike Magrath, Vehicle Testing Assistant @ 31,485 miles. <br /><br /><div><br /></div>";s:14:"date_timestamp";i:1215462924;}}s:7:"channel";a:8:{s:5:"title";s:20:"Long-Term Road Tests";s:4:"link";s:35:"http://blogs.edmunds.com/roadtests/";s:8:"language";s:2:"en";s:9:"copyright";s:14:"Copyright 2008";s:13:"lastbuilddate";s:31:"Tue, 08 Jul 2008 17:33:30 -0800";s:9:"generator";s:36:"http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/";s:4:"docs";s:41:"http://www.rssboard.org/rss-specification";s:7:"tagline";N;}s:9:"textinput";a:0:{}s:5:"image";a:0:{}s:9:"feed_type";s:3:"RSS";s:12:"feed_version";s:3:"2.0";s:8:"encoding";s:10:"ISO-8859-1";s:16:"_source_encoding";s:0:"";s:5:"ERROR";s:0:"";s:7:"WARNING";s:0:"";s:19:"_CONTENT_CONSTRUCTS";a:6:{i:0;s:7:"content";i:1;s:7:"summary";i:2;s:4:"info";i:3;s:5:"title";i:4;s:7:"tagline";i:5;s:9:"copyright";}s:16:"_KNOWN_ENCODINGS";a:3:{i:0;s:5:"UTF-8";i:1;s:8:"US-ASCII";i:2;s:10:"ISO-8859-1";}s:5:"stack";a:0:{}s:9:"inchannel";b:0;s:6:"initem";b:0;s:9:"incontent";b:0;s:11:"intextinput";b:0;s:7:"inimage";b:0;s:17:"current_namespace";b:0;s:13:"last_modified";s:31:"Wed, 09 Jul 2008 00:45:18 GMT
