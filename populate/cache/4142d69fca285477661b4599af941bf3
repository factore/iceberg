<blockquote><p>Yahoo! Announces Realignment to Support Core Strategies</p>
<p>Centralizes Audience Product Development; Forms New U.S. Region;</p>
<p>Realigns Technology Organization</p>
<p>SUNNYVALE, Calif., Jun 26, 2008 (BUSINESS WIRE) &#8212; Yahoo! Inc. (Nasdaq:YHOO), a leading global Internet company, today announced changes to its organization aimed at improving its products, technologies and execution. The moves support its strategy to be the starting point for the most users, the must-buy for the most advertisers and the platform of choice for developers.</p>
<p>Key elements Yahoo! announced are the centralization of consumer product development to enhance the company&#8217;s ability to release products worldwide; the creation of a U.S. region focused on bringing products to market for users, advertisers and publishers; formation of an insights strategy team; and enhancements to the technology infrastructure to optimize the use of data and improve coordination between product and engineering teams.</p>
<p>&#8220;These moves accelerate the ability of our deep and talented team to build great products, grow our audiences and improve monetization globally,&#8221; said Jerry Yang, CEO. &#8220;They are designed to put us in an even better position to leverage our leading global audience and capture the opportunity we see in the convergence of search and display advertising.&#8221;</p>
<p>Business and Product Changes</p>
<p>The company is creating three new teams that will report to President Sue Decker. An Audience Products Division will assume responsibility for companywide product strategy and product management. It will be led by Ash Patel who previously managed the company&#8217;s Platforms &#038; Infrastructure group. A U.S. region with accountability for all go-to-market activity in the U.S. will be led by Hilary Schneider, who previously headed the company&#8217;s Global Partner Solutions group. Finally, an Insights Strategy team will assume responsibility for centralizing and executing a common strategy for the use of data and analysis across Yahoo!. The company plans to name this group&#8217;s leader within the next few weeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;The changes we&#8217;re making today will help deliver superior global products for users and enable faster and better decision-making,&#8221; said President Sue Decker. &#8220;This is a logical next step in light of our success last year in moving to a more centralized approach to developing world-class marketing products. We have planned these changes deliberately over the past several months to clarify responsibilities and to capitalize on the scale advantages while allowing for fine tuning to meet local market needs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Technology and Infrastructure Changes</p>
<p>Yahoo! is making changes to its technology organization, led by Chief Technology Officer Ari Balogh, to better position the company to execute on its strategic priorities. Principal changes are developing a world-class cloud computing and storage infrastructure; rewiring Yahoo! onto common platforms; and creating a stronger partnership between product and engineering teams.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since my arrival at Yahoo! earlier this year, we&#8217;ve carefully evaluated the best possible configuration of our technology group to support our business strategies,&#8221; said Balogh. &#8220;I&#8217;m excited by the depth of our team which&#8211;combined with the talent we continue to recruit&#8211;will execute even better under this new structure.&#8221;</p>
<p>In order to expand its cloud computing capabilities, the Company will form a Cloud Computing &#038; Data Infrastructure Group, charged with developing a computing infrastructure that balances scalability with cost effectiveness. It will move all consumer-facing platform teams to the Audience Technology Group, led by Venkat Panchapakesan. In addition, it is putting new leadership in place behind Yahoo!&#8217;s search group, naming Prabhakar Raghavan to direct search strategy and Tuoc Luong as the interim leader of the search product team. Both Prabhakar and Tuoc will also continue in their roles as the leaders of Yahoo! Research and Search Engineering respectively. In addition, David Ku will lead the Advertising Technology Group within Search.</p>
<p>Yahoo!&#8217;s Marketing Products Division, Connected Life and Corporate Marketing groups will continue to operate as they do today. </p></blockquote>

<p>Google went with a relative unknown here, but Pichette (a Rhodes Scholar and former McKinsey consultant) must have done well on the brain teasers Google famously asks all incoming employees. Pichette will be counting some of his own cash. At today&#8217;s stock price of $532, Pichette is looking at $1.7 million just in restricted stock a year from now. Add a $500,000 signing bonus, plus the here&#8217;s-another-$500,000-for sticking-around-six&#8211;whole-months bonus, plus his $450,000 base salary, plus another <em>regular</em> bonus of as much as $1.125 million and the total comes to $4.3 million. And that is not even counting the stock options. (In comparison, last year George Reyes brought home $5.1 million in total compensation.

<p>?Google has agreed to pay Patrick a special one-time sign-on bonus of $500,000 (taxed as supplemental income).</p>
<p>?Google has agreed to pay Patrick an additional special bonus of $500,000 (taxed as supplemental income) upon completion of six months of employment. In the event that Patrick?s employment is terminated by Google prior to the end of this six-month period, this additional bonus will be paid out in full within 30 days from the date of termination. </p>
<p>?If Patrick terminates his employment with Google before the one year anniversary of his start date then Patrick will be required to repay the special bonus amounts described above, prorated for time spent at Google. </p>
<p>Google has agreed to grant Patrick four new hire equity grants: </p>
<p>? stock option to purchase 11,112 shares of the Google?s Class A common stock pursuant to Google?s 2004 Stock Plan. The stock option will vest at a rate of 25% on the date one year after Patrick commences employment and will vest an additional 2.083% each month thereafter, for a total vesting period of 48 months. </p>

<p>MySpace is taking a much more interesting approach than Google, which controls data sent to third party sites via an iframe. MySpace is actually streaming data to these sites, which allows for true integration between the services, not just a bolted-on social tool.</p>
<p>Developers can access any publicly available profile data from a MySpace user and integrate it into their site. This includes a user&#8217;s name, picture, bio, social graph (list of friends), and other information. Users authorize the data transfer via a one-time secure <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://oauth.net/">OAuth</a> login to MySpace from the third party service. The service is then allowed to access the data.</p>
<p>Since actual data is being streamed out of MySpace, they have a strict terms of use policy that forbids third party sites from storing or caching the data, other than the unique MySpace user id of the user. Each time a page is rendered the third party must re-request the data from MySpace via a set of APIs. That means any changes by the user to their MySpace profile data or friends list will be instantly applied across third parties who access the data.</p>
<p>Like Google and Facebook, users will be able to revoke access by any third party via a privacy control panel on their MySpace account:</p>

Actual Data Portability, But No Syncing</strong></big></p>
<p>This is a real move towards data portability, since MySpace is actually allowing data out of its server vault. The fact that third parties can&#8217;t store that data isn&#8217;t a perfect solution, since MySpace retains ultimate control of it (I discuss this problem in my <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/03/30/friendfeed-the-centralized-me-and-data-portability/">Centralized Me</a> post). True data portability requires constant syncing of data so that the users remain in control. But until <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.techcrunchit.com/2008/06/26/the-new-datastream-aggregators-friendfeed-and-standards/">real standards emerge on just how to do that</a> (and there are some big hurdles), MySpace&#8217;s approach seems more than reasonable. This is a real step forward in terms of user data rights, and I expect we&#8217;ll see a ton of very creative implementations of Data Availability.</p>
<p>We are building a test application now and should have it live within a few hours. Look for lots of implementations over the next few days.</p>

<p>As the weekend progressed it seemed clear that anything was possible. More than a few people saw Yang stepping down, with a <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/06/15/nytimes-article-reverberates-through-yahoo-whos-their-next-ceo/">new CEO stepping in</a>. Other theories (all coming from Yahoo senior ranks) predicted anything from a merger, restructuring, asset sale, etc. Saturday was the low point; fear was rampant.</p>
<p>Then Yang reappeared, with a renewed determination to stay in power, fight off all these new activist shareholders and keep the status quo, say people close to Yahoo. No one seems to know exactly what happened to turn him around, but they say he&#8217;s digging in and keeping up the fight to keep Yahoo at least partially independent. </p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/06/25/yahoo-issues-letter-defending-google-deal/">Today&#8217;s letter to shareholders</a> was a not-so-subtle way of showing that Yang remains in control of the company, and retains the confidence of his board. And the board of directors also retains confidence in itself, apparently: <em>&#8220;Your Current Board of Directors Has the Knowledge, Experience and Commitment to Best Represent Your Interests and Maximize Stockholder Value.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><big><strong>Microsoft Negotiations Heating Up Again</strong></big></p>
<p>Microsoft is fighting for Yahoo in two ways - First, they&#8217;re denying that any talks are occurring in the hope of keeping Yahoo&#8217;s stock price down. This keeps the PR people busy as they field calls and answer direct questions indirectly. Meanwhile, a contingent of Microsoft and Yahoo insiders, desperate to marry these two companies, keep telling us that <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/06/24/sources-microsoft-and-yahoo-talks-back-on/">negotiations are very much alive</a>, even if not officially recognized.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s Orwellian, but everyone knows Microsoft and Yahoo are talking, but since they <em>officially aren&#8217;t talking</em>, we&#8217;re not supposed to report on it. Meanwhile, the discussions go on.</p>
<p>So what kind of deal are they not talking about? It could be a full buyout. Or it could be a partial buyout tied to that fugly <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/06/14/hey-microsoft-how-bout-we-do-that-first-deal-you-offered/">search asset acquisition deal</a> Microsoft put on the table after merger talks broke down. One person close to the negotiations pegged a full buyout by end of year at 60% likely.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/06/12/yahoo-announces-non-exclusive-search-agreement-with-google/">What about that Google deal</a>? Well, it turns out there&#8217;s no penalty at all if Yahoo simply never implements it. Google can terminate the agreement, but there&#8217;s no downside to Yahoo. If Yahoo sells itself to someone they have to pay a steep $250 million fee to Google. <strong>But an interesting detail: Microsoft can buy up to 35% of Yahoo without triggering that $250 million penalty fee to Google.</strong> See the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/06/14/hey-microsoft-how-bout-we-do-that-first-deal-you-offered/">full analysis in our previous post</a>.

And the board of directors also retains confidence in itself, apparently: <em>&#8220;Your Current Board of Directors Has the Knowledge, Experience and Commitment to Best Represent Your Interests and Maximize Stockholder Value.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><big><strong>Microsoft Negotiations Heating Up Again</strong></big></p>
<p>Microsoft is fighting for Yahoo in two ways - First, they&#8217;re denying that any talks are occurring in the hope of keeping Yahoo&#8217;s stock price down. This keeps the PR people busy as they field calls and answer direct questions indirectly. Meanwhile, a contingent of Microsoft and Yahoo insiders, desperate to marry these two companies, keep telling us that <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/06/24/sources-microsoft-and-yahoo-talks-back-on/">negotiations are very much alive</a>, even if not officially recognized.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s Orwellian, but everyone knows Microsoft and Yahoo are talking, but since they <em>officially aren&#8217;t talking</em>, we&#8217;re not supposed to report on it. Meanwhile, the discussions go on.</p>
<p>So what kind of deal are they not talking about? It could be a full buyout. Or it could be a partial buyout tied to that fugly <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/06/14/hey-microsoft-how-bout-we-do-that-first-deal-you-offered/">search asset acquisition deal</a> Microsoft put on the table after merger talks broke down. One person close to the negotiations pegged a full buyout by end of year at 60% likely.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/06/12/yahoo-announces-non-exclusive-search-agreement-with-google/">What about that Google deal</a>? Well, it turns out there&#8217;s no penalty at all if Yahoo simply never implements it. Google can terminate the agreement, but there&#8217;s no downside to Yahoo. If Yahoo sells itself to someone they have to pay a steep $250 million fee to Google. <strong>But an interesting detail: Microsoft can buy up to 35% of Yahoo without triggering that $250 million penalty fee to Google.</strong> See the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/06/14/hey-microsoft-how-bout-we-do-that-first-deal-you-offered/">full analysis in our previous post</a>.

</p></blockquote>
<p>Judges will narrow the submissions down to five candidates, who will be voted on by the MySpace community. The two contestants with the highest number of votes will be sent to the national conventions, where they&#8217;ll serve as reporters representing the MySpace community.

<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eyealike.com">Eyealike</a>, a video and image recognition company, has released an update to its &#8216;Eyealike Faces&#8217; product that makes it easier for users to find their ideal match on dating sites. Eyealike Faces uses image matching technology to compare faces across databases consisting of millions of photos - the idea being that you can upload a photo of your ideal mate and get a listing of the best matches. Unfortunately, you won&#8217;t be able to try out a demo on your own - Eyealike only licenses the technology to third parties (a deal with a major dating site is in the works, so you won&#8217;t have to wait long).</p>
<p>The concept may be a little strange to some (the word superficial comes to mind), but physical attraction is obviously an important component for many people looking for a date. The new release of Eyealike includes &#8220;Face Levers&#8221;, which let users modify certain traits in the pictures they&#8217;ve uploaded. Looking for a woman with Angelina Jolie&#8217;s eyes but a slightly softer jaw? Just tweak the levers and bit and meet your future soulmate.</p>
<p>At least that&#8217;s what supposed to happen. The demo I saw wasn&#8217;t too impressive, but this was likely a result of a limited photo database of only a few thousand instead of the millions of images the technology is designed for. We&#8217;ll have to wait until the technology is incorporated into a major dating site to see if it is as effective as it promises.</p>
<p>Another technology company that offers similar image matching is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.picitup.com">Picitup</a>, which didn&#8217;t work particularly well when we last <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/05/12/new-visual-search-engine-picitup-needs-to-pick-up-its-game/">reviewed</a> it.</p>

Vint Cerf, the <a rel="nofollow">&#8220;father of the Internet&#8221;</a> and Google&#8217;s Internet evangelist, made this radical suggestion while he was sitting next to me on a panel yesterday about national tech policy at the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.techpresident.com/blog/entry/26268/pdf2008_schedule_for_june_24_day_two">Personal Democracy Forum</a>. Maybe he was inspired by the presence of one of the other panelists, Claudio Prado, from Brazil&#8217;s Ministry of Culture, who kept on talking about the importance of embracing Internet &#8220;peeracy.&#8221; (Although, I should note that Mr. Cerf frowned upon that ill-advised coinage). But I think (or hope, rather) that he was really trying to spark a debate about whether the Internet should be treated more like the public resource that it is.</p>
<p>His comment was in the context of a bigger discussion about the threat to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_neutrality">Net neutrality</a> posed by the cable and phone companies, who are making moves to control the amount and types of bits that can go through their pipes. It was made almost in passing and the discussion quickly moved to other topics. </p>
<p>Maybe I didn&#8217;t fully understand him (I wasn&#8217;t taking notes), and he certainly is better versed in the issues at hand than everyone else who was in that auditorium combined. But nationalizing the Internet is bad idea. (I can&#8217;t believe I even have to say this). It would set a horrible precedent, would undermine confidence in the American economy, and would be difficult to pull off. </p>
<p>I tried to press Mr. Cerf on how exactly such a scheme would work without making Internet service even less competitive than it is today. He offered that the government could put the actual running of the service out to competitive bidding. It&#8217;s still a bad idea.</p>
<p>The Internet is essentially a series of agreements between owners of different networks about how data gets passed from one to the other. It is not clear what property exactly would be nationalized. AT&#038;T&#8217;s backbone fiber network, for instance, sometimes carries Internet traffic, and sometimes carries telephone voice traffic. So if the government were to confiscate all the data pipes, they would nationalize the phone industry as well. </p>
<p>While nationalizing the Internet is the wrong solution, the problem it would address is very real. The ground rules for how the Internet is used need to be clarified. And that was the bigger point that Mr. Cerf was trying to make. But the government does not need to own the underlying assets that make up the Internet in order to set up ground rules that American companies need to abide by. That is what laws are for.</p>
<p>I have some ideas on how the government can actually do something useful here. More on that in a future post.

<blockquote><p>Dear Fellow Stockholders:</p>
<p>We are writing to update you on the latest developments here at Yahoo!, including our recently announced commercial agreement with Google and the outcome of our discussions with Microsoft regarding a potential transaction.</p>
<p>On June 12, we announced a non-exclusive agreement with Google that we expect will generate approximately $250 to $450 million in incremental operating cash flow for Yahoo! in the first twelve months following implementation. This cash flow will enhance our profitability as well as help support achievement of our key strategic objectives. Combined with continuing advances in our own search capability, the agreement is an important step in our efforts to capitalize on the high-growth online advertising opportunities where we are best positioned to compete successfully and create more value.</p>
<p>Let us explain why we find this new agreement so exciting.</p>
<p>The Yahoo!-Google Agreement is Financially Attractive and Strikes the Right Strategic Balance.</p>
<p>Under the agreement with Google, Yahoo! will continue to provide algorithmic and sponsored search results, but now will also have the ability to run sponsored search ads supplied by Google alongside Yahoo!&#8217;s search results. Advertisers will pay Google directly for each click on Google paid search results appearing on Yahoo!. Google will then pay us a fee (in industry jargon, traffic acquisition cost) based on revenue realized from click-throughs on ads supplied to Yahoo! by Google.</p>
<p>This carefully structured agreement strikes the right strategic balance, enhancing our financial results while advancing our strategic objectives of being the &#8220;starting point&#8221; for the most users on the Internet and offering such compelling value that advertisers will see us as the &#8220;must buy&#8221; in online advertising.</p>
<p>One of our key strategies for achieving these objectives is to capitalize on the increasing convergence of search and display advertising, where we are especially well positioned to compete and succeed. We have already accelerated our efforts to strengthen our presence in display through a variety of initiatives and acquisitions in recent months. Our new commercial agreement with Google enhances our ability to pursue this strategy.</p>
<p>Another key strategy is to open our platform to other developers to optimize monetization for our advertisers and publishers and provide the best experience for our users. We see this agreement as a natural extension of the efforts we have already made toward an open marketplace.</p>
<p>The Google agreement is non-exclusive and provides strategic and operational flexibility for Yahoo!. It allows Yahoo! to use Google&#8217;s services in those areas where Google monetizes our inventory more effectively but also permits us to continue to use our own search technology in areas where we believe we are most competitive. The net result is that the agreement helps us accelerate one of our strategic aims&#8211;closing the monetization gap. At the same time, it allows Yahoo! to continue to compete aggressively in search and display advertising.</p>
<p>Importantly, the agreement does not prevent Yahoo! from pursuing other alternatives that could increase stockholder value. Because the agreement can be terminated by either party upon a change in control, it would not preclude a transaction with Microsoft or any other potential acquiror in the future.</p>
<p> The Yahoo!-Google Agreement Does More for Stockholder Value than Microsoft&#8217;s Search-Only Hybrid Proposal.</p>
<p>We also want to update you on the conclusion to our discussions with Microsoft regarding a potential transaction. As we explained in our last letter, our board and management held numerous meetings and conversations with Microsoft about its proposal to acquire Yahoo!, both before and after Microsoft withdrew that proposal on May 3. On June 8, our Chairman, Roy Bostock, other independent board members, and members of Yahoo!&#8217;s management team again met in person with Microsoft representatives. At that meeting, Microsoft stated unequivocally that it has no interest in acquiring all of Yahoo!, even at the price range Microsoft had previously suggested.</p>
<p>Microsoft did propose an alternative transaction. Rather than acquire our whole company as it had been proposing for months, Microsoft now proposed to acquire only our search business for $1 billion and a share of future search advertising revenue. This proposal also included an $8 billion investment in Yahoo! but required Yahoo! to commit to a 10-year exclusive arrangement that would have made us dependent on Microsoft for all of our search business. It would also have given Microsoft veto rights on certain future Yahoo! actions, including a sale of Yahoo!. Our board of directors and management made a great effort&#8211;and conducted in depth negotiations&#8211;to elicit a feasible proposal from Microsoft that made strategic and financial sense for Yahoo!, but without success.</p>
<p>While Microsoft&#8217;s search-only hybrid proposal may have been helpful to Microsoft, our board and management concluded it would have had a significant adverse impact on Yahoo! strategically, leaving the Company without the operational control of search assets and technology we view as critical to our objective of becoming a leader in the converging search and display advertising business. The board and its advisers also carefully studied the financial impact of Microsoft&#8217;s proposal and concluded that it would have provided no meaningful improvement to our operating cash flow. In short, this proposal would have generated substantially less value for Yahoo! stockholders than Microsoft has suggested.</p>
<p>Based on all the key factors&#8211;strengthening our competitiveness, protecting our strategic position, generating attractive financial returns&#8211;the Google agreement is far better than Microsoft&#8217;s search-only hybrid proposal. That&#8217;s why we moved forward with it.</p>
<p>Your Current Board of Directors Has the Knowledge, Experience and Commitment to Best Represent Your Interests and Maximize Stockholder Value.</p>
<p>The events of recent weeks underscore the fact that your board of directors is far better qualified to represent your interests in the effort to maximize stockholder value than the slate put forward by Carl Icahn.</p>
<p>Based on Mr. Icahn&#8217;s narrow agenda, it seems highly unlikely that either he or his slate would bring added value to Yahoo!. Consider the following:</p>
<p>&#8211; Mr. Icahn put forward his slate so as to sell Yahoo! to Microsoft, even though he had no knowledge of the sustained efforts made by your current board and management to determine whether Microsoft was willing to engage in a transaction that would provide appropriate value and certainty of achieving that value. On June 8, Microsoft once again made it perfectly clear that it is not currently interested in acquiring Yahoo!.<br /> &#8212; Mr. Icahn publicly opposed any alternative form of transaction with Microsoft. Your board and management, after thorough and deliberate negotiations and evaluation, separately concluded on its own that the alternative hybrid deal proposed by Microsoft was, indeed, not in the best interests of the Company or its stockholders.<br /> &#8212; Mr. Icahn urged, as an alternative to a Microsoft transaction, that Yahoo! find a way to partner with Google that would not preclude a transaction with Microsoft in the future. We have done exactly that through the commercial agreement with Google we announced on June 12.</p>
<p>Simply put, you can choose to vote for a slate of nominees with no articulated plan for the future of Yahoo!&#8211;and who now have essentially no alternative agenda to offer you&#8211;or you can choose to vote for your existing board of directors which has the independence, experience, knowledge and commitment to navigate the Company through the rapidly-changing Internet environment, execute on our strategic objectives and deliver value for Yahoo! and its stockholders.</p>
<p>It is time for Yahoo! to turn its undivided attention to implementing its key strategies, and we therefore urge you to reject Mr. Icahn&#8217;s slate and his ill-defined agenda.</p>
<p>We strongly urge you to vote your WHITE Proxy Card today for your current board of directors.</p>
<p>We look forward to sharing our progress with you as we move forward and we thank you for your support.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Roy Bostock &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jerry Yang<br />
Chairman of the Board &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chief Executive Officer

<p>The site now features leaderboards that should encourage users to become &#8220;experts&#8221; in their region, which will be essential if it hopes to generate worthwhile content. Users now also can create groups, where they&#8217;ll be able share information and travel plans with trusted friends.</p>
<p>In conjunction with these new features, TripSay is expanding its private beta; TechCrunch readers can grab one of 500 invites by emailing <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto: info@tripsay.com?subject=TechCrunch">info@tripsay.com</a>. TripSay competes with countless other travel sites, but tries to differentiate itself by offering fewer, but more targeted, recommendations.</p>

<p>Last February <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/02/11/rocketon-gets-5-m-for-embeddable-virtual-kids-world/">we hinted</a> at South San Francisco startup <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.rocketon.com/">Rocketon&#8217;s</a> plan to release a virtual world that spanned the web. At the time, it appeared as though the company was pursuing an embeddable widget strategy. But instead of integrating virtual worlds into webpages, it has actually placed one on top of them so that avatars can roam the web just as you currently surf it.</p>
<p>Comparisons can be drawn to both <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.weblin.com/">Weblin</a> and <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.pmog.com/">PMOG</a>. Whereas Weblin places a little avatar on the bottom of your browser that can be used to chat with other visitors to a webpage, PMOG <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/05/12/pmog-launches-go-lay-some-mines-on-your-friends-myspace-page/">turns web surfing</a> into a game with mine laying and loot plundering.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/rocketon_shot.png" class="shot"/></p>
<p>RocketOn was co-founded by two veterans from the gaming industry - Eric Hayashi and Steve Hoffman - so it comes as no surprise that its avatars participate in games with each other (as they do on virtual world sites like <a rel="nofollow">Club Penguin</a>). However, like most other virtual worlds, Rocketon is also about chatting with friends and strangers, and dressing up your avatar in fun guises. The basic service is free but users can buy special virtual goods with real money or points that they&#8217;ve earned by performing certain tasks (or simply spending time using RocketOn).</p>
<p>How does one layer a virtual world onto the web? RocketOn has achieved this in two ways: first with a browser plugin, and second with a Flash browser emulator. Newcomers are expected to try out the virtual world by loading up a Flash app that can be used to browse the web with RocketOn superimposed. More committed users can download and install the plugin so that they can navigate the web as they normally would.</p>
<p>In addition to earning revenue from the sale of virtual goods, RocketOn is working to sign sponsorship deals with brands on the web. Say you visit insecticide company <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.blackflag.com/">Black Flag&#8217;s</a> website. Were Black Flag to sponsor RocketOn, it could build out its own interactive objects (like a roach motel) and entice avatars to participate in its own branded games (like killing as many roaches as possible with a spray can). Likewise, Gap could roll out a virtual clothing store ontop of its website where avatars buy its clothes and wear them wherever they go on the net. </p>
<p>RocketOn will remain in private beta for at least a few weeks longer, but we have 500 invitations to give our readers now. Get your account <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.rocketon.com/techcrunch.html">here</a> while they last.</p>

<p>Polls are popular on the Web because they are interactive without requiring too much effort. They are also a good way to collect a lot of data from users across the Web. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sodahead.com/">SodaHead</a>, a startup founded by former MySpace executives Jason Feffer and Michael Glazer, announced an $8.4 million series B investment today. The round was led by Mission Ventures and Mohr Davidow. (The company previously raised $4.25 million from Mohr Davidow, Ron Conway, and Tech Coast Angels in January, 2007).</p>
<p>Since the site launched last September, it has attracted 600,000 registered members who have submitted three million answers. SodaHead competes with PollDaddy, SurveyMonkey, and Vizu, although it is targeted more at the MySpace crowd. And you can add songs, videos,and images to the polls. Think <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://answers.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Answers </a>meets <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.polldaddy.com/">PollDaddy</a>. The company says it is really going after Yahoo Answers. Says Glazer;</p>
<blockquote><p><em>We are a community site, around any topic people are taking about. With Yahoo Answers, what they missed is the community aspect. </em></p></blockquote>
<p>Although any question a user makes can be spread virally as a widget, 90 percent of SodaHead&#8217;s traffic still goes through its site. Traffic has been ramping up nicely to 1.2 million U.S. visitors a month, according to comScore (Yahoo Answers, which seems to be doing fine just the way it is, has 33.6 million and growing).</p>
<p>The site is only running Google AdSense ads right now, but since SodaHead is building up a database of the preferences of members based on what kinds of questions they answer in different categories, and even their specific answers, Glazer is confident SodaHead will be able to do better ad targeting overtime. Another revenue source is helping brands engage with consumers through their own polls.</p>

<p>Since the site launched last September, it has attracted 600,000 registered members who have submitted three million answers. SodaHead competes with PollDaddy, SurveyMonkey, and Vizu, although it is targeted more at the MySpace crowd. And you can add songs, videos,and images to the polls. Think <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://answers.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Answers </a>meets <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.polldaddy.com/">PollDaddy</a>. The company says it is really going after Yahoo Answers. Says Glazer;</p>
<blockquote><p><em>We are a community site, around any topic people are taking about. With Yahoo Answers, what they missed is the community aspect. </em></p></blockquote>
<p>Although any question a user makes can be spread virally as a widget, 90 percent of SodaHead&#8217;s traffic still goes through its site. Traffic has been ramping up nicely to 1.2 million U.S. visitors a month, according to comScore (Yahoo Answers, which seems to be doing fine just the way it is, has 33.6 million and growing).</p>
<p>The site is only running Google AdSense ads right now, but since SodaHead is building up a database of the preferences of members based on what kinds of questions they answer in different categories, and even their specific answers, Glazer is confident SodaHead will be able to do better ad targeting overtime. Another revenue source is helping brands engage with consumers through their own polls.</p>

<p>What are venture capitalists looking for? If you are a startup entrepreneur looking for funding, it&#8217;s always a good idea to know what investment themes a VC is interested and tailor your pitch to those themes. Yesterday morning, I saw presentations from three venture firms?<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/union-square-ventures">Union Square Ventures</a>, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/dfj-gotham-ventures">DFJ Gotham Ventures</a>, and <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/first-round-capital">First Round Capital</a>?at an event hosted by the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.mediakitchen.tv/">Media Kitchen</a>. Each of the presenters outlined some of the themes their venture firms are trying to ride. They all boil down to structural change in one form or another. </p>
<p>One common theme everyone seemed excited about is that, after years of hope and anticipation, the mobile Web finally seems within reach. The rise of the iPhone and the work on Android hold out the promise for a mobile Web that doesn&#8217;t suck,&#8221; as DFJ Gotham partner Thatcher Bell puts it. By that, he means a fully functioning mobile Web that is open to developers so that they can create the same types of experiences on cell phones that they are creating on PCs. Another common theme is the continued personalization of content, commerce, and advertising. And data-driven startups that make sense of the deluge of information and media now available to everyone are also likely to get a hearing from these VCs.</p>
<p>Albert Wenger, a partner at Union Square Ventures, notes that we might be a little bit ahead of ourselves in the hype cycle (see slide above), but that the impact of some of the changes we are just now seeing now on the Web will eventually catch up to the hype. The structural changes and other shifts that Union Square likes to invest in include:</p>
<blockquote><p>The decline of the firm and the rise of one-to-one commerce<br />
Merging of cyberspace and real space<br />
Unified identity (across different sites and services)<br />
Generational shift<br />
Global growth of the Web<br />
Mobile</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course the Web is becoming more social, programmable, playful, and intelligent, but there are also bigger shifts occurring as the Web audience becomes more mobile and global. There is also a fundamental generational shift going on among Web users, which Wenger defines as: </p>
<blockquote><p><em>The difference between people who dated before they had their first computer and those who had their first computer before they started dating.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The risks he worries about are:</p>
<blockquote><p>Scaling<br />
Net Neutrality<br />
Data Ownership</p></blockquote>
<p>Any Web startup that becomes popular fast has to deal with scaling issues that can derail it (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/06/23/john-adams-will-try-to-fix-twitter/">see Twitter</a>, a Union Square investment). Wenger, though, thinks that these issues will go away as cloud computing matures. Net Neutrality issues could pose a risk if ISPs decide to start blocking or discriminating against certain types of data. And the whole question of who owns the data that Web companies accumulate about users could result in some privacy backlash down the line. Startups should have answers to how they plan on handling these risks.</p>
<p>Despite signs of a <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/06/11/internet-display-advertising-slowed-in-first-quarter/">recent slowdown</a> in Web advertising, the VCs are still bullish about the ability of online advertising to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/06/23/top-100-advertisers-shifted-1-billion-to-the-web-last-year-at-the-expense-of-tv-and-newspapers/">keep taking share</a> from other media. And as digital media becomes more personalized, so too does the advertising. Bell from DFJ Gotham sees the evolution of the way advertising is delivered (see slide below) going from undifferentiated mass media to targeting by categories, behavior, context, and finally the social graph. Here are the themes he is looking at:</p>
<blockquote><p>Atomization of content<br />
The arrival of the mobile Web (finally)<br />
Hyper-targeting of advertising<br />
The coming of human-friendly interfaces<br />
Cloud computing</p></blockquote>
<p>He thinks we still have along way to go in terms of making the Web easy to use. For instance, Bell compares Google&#8217;s current interface to the C: prompt days of the PC before Windows. Says Bell:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>This is a really good way for a search engine to get input from a human and for Google to make money. It is not the best way for a human to interact with a computer.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>He argues that more <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/04/21/a-better-interface-for-image-search/">intuitive Web and search interfaces</a>, like SearchMe, are needed. </p>
<p>There may be an IPO drought going on right now (not a single venture-backed IPO has gone out so far in the second quarter, according to the National Venture Capital Association), but VCs are still looking for the next, next thing. </p>

<p>Open operating systems, for most folks, means that the operating system is essentially free. The average computer user knows that Linux is free, as in beer, while Windows costs money. The case is the same for mobile OSes although, until very recently, the idea of purposely using an open OS has been a fairly nebulous concept.</p>
<p>To be clear open mobile OSes have been around for years, starting most prominently with the QTopia project that ran on ARM hardware found in many PDAs and phones. The Linux kernel plays well with almost any platform, making it ideal for small installations.</p>
<p>With the announcement of an <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.techcrunchit.com/2008/06/24/symbian-goes-open-source-courtesy-of-nokia/">?open? version of Symbian</a> coming soon, let?s take a look at what open means to the average consumer.</p>
<p><b>Android</b> - Google?s smartphone OS is probably about as open as you can get. It?s designed to run on almost any hardware and includes a fully open and free UI complete with source code. It costs nothing for carriers to use and if, if used in its official form, simply brings Google apps and content to the fore at opportune times. To the average consumer Android should be able to add smartphone functionality to a number of odd devices, including phones that once depended on proprietary, no-name operating systems like the Motorola RAZR.</p>
<p><b>iPhone OSX</b> - iPhone?s OSX uses a Mach kernel which, like Linux, is fairly open and well-documented. Unlike Linux, however, the price of the iPhone?s kernel is bundled into the cost of the actual phone and cannot be sold to third parties. The SDK or programming tools for the OS, however, are quite popular and are free. This ensures that programmers can harness the full power of the OS without having to dig too deeply into the core. As a whole, OS X is as close to being open as you can get without really being ?open? and fully cross-platform.</p>
<p><b>Windows Mobile</b> ? Windows Mobile is a closed operating system. The common user interface remains unchanged across devices, however, third-party applications can be developed by writing programs using software like Visual C++. Windows Mobile also makes use of the .NET Compact Framework, which is similar to the .NET Framework found on Windows-based PCs.</p>
<p><b>Symbian</b> ? Currently, the Symbian operating system is not classified as open source, although with Nokia?s recent announcement, it will soon be available under the royalty-free Eclipse Public License. As it stands now, though, handset manufacturers that make use of the Symbian operating system are only provided with certain parts of the source code. It is expected to be fully opened up within the next two years. Symbian is the most widely used mobile operating system in the world today.</p>
<p>One interesting aside: there is an excellent chance that Symbian will not make it through its conversion to openness alive. The OS is old and crotchety, unable to handle data intensive applications with the same aplomb RIM or even the iPhone OS have. Once the platform is open, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/06/24/andrew_on_symbian/page2.html">Nokia will most likely put it out to pasture</a>, watch as the developers branch it off, and then build something entirely new. As popular as it is, I doubt many of us would miss Symbian&#8217;s various foibles and flaws.

<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.kosmix.com/">Kosmix</a>, until now a vertical search engine for information about health, automobiles and travel, transformed itself into a universal search engine for all subjects earlier today during a general redesign.</p>
<p>The move has been anticipated since at least <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/09/12/will-kosmixs-plan-to-take-vertical-search-horizontal-go-flat/">last September</a>, and was described by co-founder Anand Rajaraman in a <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.beet.tv/2008/06/kosmix-topical.html">Beet.tv interview</a> posted less than a week ago. </p>
<p>Now when users conduct keyword searches on Kosmix (much as they would on a traditional search engine like Google or Ask), they are presented with mashups of results from a variety of sources. Unlike <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.mahalo.com/">Mahalo</a>, Kosmix itself doesn&#8217;t publish any of the content it displays. Rather, it pulls it all from services like Flickr, Google, Wikipedia, TheFind, Yahoo Answers, Amazon, Truveo, and YouTube. </p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/kosmix_shot.png"><img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/kosmix_thumb.png" class="shot2"/></a></p>
<p>Results from each of these sources are shown in their own modules, which are packed rather tightly in a three column layout. We hear that there are hundreds of possible modules, although only a small subset of these show up for each query. </p>
<p>If you are interested in a particular result type (videos, photos, blogs, etc), you can expand it into its own page for better browsing. Kosmix also suggests related searches in each of these views for when you want to jump around between &#8220;topics&#8221; as you would on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>In his Beet.tv interview, Rajaraman claimed 15 million unique visitors per month for Kosmix. The vast majority of these visitors <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://siteanalytics.compete.com/righthealth.com+rightautos.com+righttravel.com/?metric=uv">appears</a> to be heading to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.righthealth.com/">RightHealth</a>, Kosmix&#8217;s health vertical site that competes with the likes of <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.imedix.com/">iMedix</a>, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.organizedwisdom.com/">OrganizedWisdom</a>, and others. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://siteanalytics.compete.com/kosmix.com/?metric=uv">According to Compete</a>, Kosmix.com attracts only about 50-100 thousand visitors per month.

<p>Now when users conduct keyword searches on Kosmix (much as they would on a traditional search engine like Google or Ask), they are presented with mashups of results from a variety of sources. Unlike <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.mahalo.com/">Mahalo</a>, Kosmix itself doesn&#8217;t publish any of the content it displays. Rather, it pulls it all from services like Flickr, Google, Wikipedia, TheFind, Yahoo Answers, Amazon, Truveo, and YouTube. </p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/kosmix_shot.png"><img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/kosmix_thumb.png" class="shot2"/></a></p>
<p>Results from each of these sources are shown in their own modules, which are packed rather tightly in a three column layout. We hear that there are hundreds of possible modules, although only a small subset of these show up for each query. </p>
<p>If you are interested in a particular result type (videos, photos, blogs, etc), you can expand it into its own page for better browsing. Kosmix also suggests related searches in each of these views for when you want to jump around between &#8220;topics&#8221; as you would on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>In his Beet.tv interview, Rajaraman claimed 15 million unique visitors per month for Kosmix. The vast majority of these visitors <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://siteanalytics.compete.com/righthealth.com+rightautos.com+righttravel.com/?metric=uv">appears</a> to be heading to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.righthealth.com/">RightHealth</a>, Kosmix&#8217;s health vertical site that competes with the likes of <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.imedix.com/">iMedix</a>, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.organizedwisdom.com/">OrganizedWisdom</a>, and others. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://siteanalytics.compete.com/kosmix.com/?metric=uv">According to Compete</a>, Kosmix.com attracts only about 50-100 thousand visitors per month.

<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amiestreet.com">Amie Street</a>, the music store that features dynamic pricing that varies according to a song&#8217;s popularity, has secured a deal with digital music distributor <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.theorchard.com">The Orchard</a>, which holds a catalog of over 1 million songs. For the time being not all of The Orchard&#8217;s music labels will be taking part in the deal, but Amie Street hopes to have them all finalized in the near future.</p>
<p>Amie Street offers musicians a unique marketplace that scales prices according to how many times a song has been purchased. Fledgling musicians trying to establish an audience will likely see their songs sell for only a few cents, but as they grow more popular song prices increase to up to 98 cents (Amie Street gets the first $5 made by each song, musicians keep 70% of any revenue thereafter). They&#8217;ve been one of our favorite startups since <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/07/23/amie-street-awesome-new-music-model/">launching in mid-2006</a>.</p>
<p>The deal marks a huge win for Amie Street, which has gradually been able to establish itself as a destination to discover new music, especially when compared to more traditional stores like iTunes and Amazon. The Orchard features a long list of notable labels and artists, and while it&#8217;s currently unclear how long it will take all of them to sign on, it&#8217;s clear that flexible pricing is being accepted as a viable business model by the music industry.</p>

Although we agree that Vista could have used a bit more time shoved back into the silicon womb for some feature buffing and bug fixing, it's not nearly as bad as most people are making it out to be. That's right, I'm actually happy with Windows Vista, which I use about one-third of the time I spend at a computer.</p> <p>This may be counterintuitive, seeing as our <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://gizmodo.com/5018985/why-i-still-use-windows-despite-the-peer-pressure">guy who defended Windows</a> doesn't even like Vista, but I've used Mac OS X and Vista side by side and simultaneously for over a year (and before that, Mac and XP) thanks to the dual-computer-controlling app <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://lifehacker.com/software/dual-monitor/hack-attack-control-multiple-computers-with-a-single-keyboard-and-mouse-254648.php">Synergy</a>. Here's why Vista's not that bad:</p> <p>1. <strong>It's more secure than Windows XP.</strong> After being implicitly responsible for botnets and security breaches through the incredible popularity of their Windows XP, Microsoft went back and made sure Vista is more secure than its predecessor. And it is. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&articleId=9084738">According to security firm PC Tools</a>, Vista had 639 unique threats over a six-month period, whereas XP had 1021. This came from much internal restructuring under the hood, but there's a chance that it might be due to Vista being a smaller target than XP for malware as well.</p> <p>2. <strong>It's the best looking Windows yet.</strong> Despite any complaints users may have about Aero hogging up too many CPU cycles or requiring a video card from this millennium to use, it's still the best looking Windows yet. I mean really, do you remember what XP <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.guidebookgallery.org/pics/gui/desktop/empty/winxppro.png">looked like</a> out of the box? With that gigantic balloon of a task bar and the green Start button. Vista's glass definitely trumps that. And then there's the underlying graphical framework changes which allow new features like live thumbnails. All these visual effects may require more power, but you can't deny that it's pleasing to look at.</p> <p><i>If you want to disable Aero for certain applications for performance or compatibility reasons, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://lifehacker.com/345959/disable-vistas-aero-effects-for-certain-programs">see here</a>.</i></p> <p>3. <strong>Games work just about as well as under XP.</strong> There's a <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/xp-vs-vista,1531-4.html">slight performance degradation</a> under Vista when compared to Windows XP using the exact same hardware. Is it noticeable? Probably, but it's somewhere around the level of 10%. There's also the consideration of DirectX 10 and the visual improvements you'll get in the future when more developers really take advantage of it. With a slightly better video card, you won't even really notice that you're going at 90FPS versus 100FPS.</p> <p>4. <strong>Vista Media Center is a fantastic DVR.</strong> Microsoft integrates their fantastic Windows Media Center Edition into Home Premium and Ultimate, and its pretty much the best DVR you can get outside of getting a TiVo. Combine it with various Media Center Extenders, of which <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.gizmodo.com/tag/media-center">there are lots</a> (such as the Xbox 360), you can get HDTV streamed to anywhere in your house from one computer in your office. Our only complaint is still that Cable Labs doesn't allow you to stick a CableCARD tuner onto just any appropriately spec'd Vista PC&mdash;you actually have to buy a machine pre-made for CableCARD.</p> <p>5. <strong>The sleep mode works.</strong> Sleep mode in Windows XP was essentially a shortcut for locking up your computer and forcing you to reboot. It actually does what it's supposed to in Vista.</p> <p>6. <strong>Built-in search is better and more useful.</strong> Vista's searching feature relies on cataloging your hard drive, then searching the resulting database to quickly (and easily) find your files. By default it's just limited to a couple user folders, but if you expand it to your entire hard drive, you'll be able to find anything fast, much like the way Spotlight works on a Mac. The downside is that during the first day or two, everything slows down while Vista indexes your computer. Best to leave it on overnight or over a weekend while you're away.</p> <p>7. <strong>User Account Control is useful for some people.</strong> I have to admit that I've turned this off but UAC&mdash;the thing that pops up and asks you for your password whenever you do something on the system level&mdash;is useful in theory for many people, especially those who share a family computer. Hide the administrator password from your parents/grandparents/kids so they won't be able to install any weird apps they're not supposed to. In practice, it's a bit annoying in that it pops up for mundane things that shouldn't really need system-level clearance. It's a step in the right direction; however, if you want to disable UAC for certain programs, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://lifehacker.com/358533/disable-vistas-user-account-controls-for-certain-programs">see here</a>.</p> <p>8. <strong>Drivers support isn't as bad as it's made out to be.</strong> Although <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/microsoft/archives/141343.asp">"Man gets Windows Vista to work with printer"</a> may be an actual non-Onion headline, the root cause of his original woes was that the man installed a Windows XP printer driver instead of the correct Vista one. But there is a smaller percentage of users who?no matter how old or new their peripheral is?can't get it to work with Windows Vista. The blame for this lies on peripheral manufacturers who either can't or won't update their drivers to support the new OS. There's not much you or Microsoft can do here, but it's rarer than you'd think from reading the internet.</p> <p>9. <strong>It's not any buggier than Windows XP.</strong> This is a bit of a corollary to #1, but out of the many, many Vista users we've seen, they almost all agree that the only times Vista has crashed or blue-screened on them was when they were doing something they usually don't do. The OS by itself rarely crashes in everyday use, and compared to even OS X Leopard, it's pretty damn sturdy. In a year's worth of daily use, we think the OS has probably only crashed once, if that.</p> <p>10. <strong>Vista is not slow if you have enough RAM.</strong> One of the main complaints that users have is that Vista is slow, but they either upgraded Vista from an old machine or they purchased a "Vista Ready" system with only 512MB to 1GB worth of RAM. You can run Vista with 1GB of RAM, but like OS X, you really want to have at least 2GB. Modern operating systems get fatter because they DO more stuff for you under the hood, such as optimizing your memory for the applications you run often so they load faster.</p> <p>We're not saying that Vista doesn't have its faults or that Windows 7 won't be better, we're saying that Vista is just not as bad as people are making it out to be. If you're on XP and you're afraid to upgrade, don't be. It's no worse than Windows XP if you pay attention to the stuff I mentioned above. As long as you've got a reasonably decent machine?and if you're reading Giz it's likely that you do?you're pretty safe in upgrading.</p> <p>That said, we do have some major complaints:</p> <p>1. <strong>Things aren't where they used to be.</strong> Holy shit. This one is the worst. Various settings are hidden under levels of menus, and for some inexplicable reason, Add/Remove Programs is no longer Add/Remove programs. What's the point of this? So people can use the hundreds of wizards more?</p> <p>2. <strong>File transfers are slower than on XP</strong>, which is slightly fixed with Service Pack 1, but still has problems. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://blogs.technet.com/markrussinovich/archive/2008/02/04/2826167.aspx">Here's the reason why</a>. And if you've got problems with slow browsing, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://lifehacker.com/380905/turn-off-vistas-auto+tuning-to-prevent-browser-slow+down">see here</a>.</p> <p>3. <strong>Wireless networking is a pain.</strong> Windows has never been great at presenting wireless networking with an intuitive UI, and Vista might be even worse than XP in this department. Stuff's buried behind various weirdly-named menus, which you have to (at least the first few times) guess at to see.</p> <p>4. <strong>Lots of balloon notifications pop up on the taskbar.</strong> Here's how to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://lifehacker.com/396223/disable-all-balloon-notifications-in-vista">shut them off</a>.</p> <p>5. <strong>Folder view in Windows Explorer doesn't remember your settings.</strong> Here's another huge pain users have run into when browsing a folder and all of a sudden having Explorer think that these are photos because there's just one photo in the directory. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/70819-windows-explorer-folder-view-settings.html">Here's how to turn that off</a>.</p> <p><i>Bonus Vista Tip: How to recover files from Vista's built-in shadow copy <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://lifehacker.com/360781/recover-files-using-vistas-built+in-shadow-copies">here</a>.</i></p> <br style="clear:both;"/> <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.pheedo.com/click.phdo?s=ffcd43d5a37f870cc042223d264b8c22"><img alt="" style="border:0;" border="0" src="http://www.pheedo.com/img.phdo?s=ffcd43d5a37f870cc042223d264b8c22"/></a> <img src="http://www.pheedo.com/feeds/tracker.php?i=ffcd43d5a37f870cc042223d264b8c22" style="display:none;" border="0" height="1" width="1" alt=""/>

Hide the administrator password from your parents/grandparents/kids so they won't be able to install any weird apps they're not supposed to. In practice, it's a bit annoying in that it pops up for mundane things that shouldn't really need system-level clearance. It's a step in the right direction; however, if you want to disable UAC for certain programs, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://lifehacker.com/358533/disable-vistas-user-account-controls-for-certain-programs">see here</a>.</p> <p>8. <strong>Drivers support isn't as bad as it's made out to be.</strong> Although <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/microsoft/archives/141343.asp">"Man gets Windows Vista to work with printer"</a> may be an actual non-Onion headline, the root cause of his original woes was that the man installed a Windows XP printer driver instead of the correct Vista one. But there is a smaller percentage of users who?no matter how old or new their peripheral is?can't get it to work with Windows Vista. The blame for this lies on peripheral manufacturers who either can't or won't update their drivers to support the new OS. There's not much you or Microsoft can do here, but it's rarer than you'd think from reading the internet.</p> <p>9. <strong>It's not any buggier than Windows XP.</strong> This is a bit of a corollary to #1, but out of the many, many Vista users we've seen, they almost all agree that the only times Vista has crashed or blue-screened on them was when they were doing something they usually don't do. The OS by itself rarely crashes in everyday use, and compared to even OS X Leopard, it's pretty damn sturdy. In a year's worth of daily use, we think the OS has probably only crashed once, if that.</p> <p>10. <strong>Vista is not slow if you have enough RAM.</strong> One of the main complaints that users have is that Vista is slow, but they either upgraded Vista from an old machine or they purchased a "Vista Ready" system with only 512MB to 1GB worth of RAM. You can run Vista with 1GB of RAM, but like OS X, you really want to have at least 2GB. Modern operating systems get fatter because they DO more stuff for you under the hood, such as optimizing your memory for the applications you run often so they load faster.</p> <p>We're not saying that Vista doesn't have its faults or that Windows 7 won't be better, we're saying that Vista is just not as bad as people are making it out to be. If you're on XP and you're afraid to upgrade, don't be. It's no worse than Windows XP if you pay attention to the stuff I mentioned above. As long as you've got a reasonably decent machine?and if you're reading Giz it's likely that you do?you're pretty safe in upgrading.</p> <p>That said, we do have some major complaints:</p> <p>1. <strong>Things aren't where they used to be.</strong> Holy shit. This one is the worst. Various settings are hidden under levels of menus, and for some inexplicable reason, Add/Remove Programs is no longer Add/Remove programs. What's the point of this? So people can use the hundreds of wizards more?</p> <p>2. <strong>File transfers are slower than on XP</strong>, which is slightly fixed with Service Pack 1, but still has problems. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://blogs.technet.com/markrussinovich/archive/2008/02/04/2826167.aspx">Here's the reason why</a>.

Stuff's buried behind various weirdly-named menus, which you have to (at least the first few times) guess at to see.</p> <p>4. <strong>Lots of balloon notifications pop up on the taskbar.</strong> Here's how to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://lifehacker.com/396223/disable-all-balloon-notifications-in-vista">shut them off</a>.</p> <p>5. <strong>Folder view in Windows Explorer doesn't remember your settings.</strong> Here's another huge pain users have run into when browsing a folder and all of a sudden having Explorer think that these are photos because there's just one photo in the directory. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/70819-windows-explorer-folder-view-settings.html">Here's how to turn that off</a>.</p> <p><i>Bonus Vista Tip: How to recover files from Vista's built-in shadow copy <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://lifehacker.com/360781/recover-files-using-vistas-built+in-shadow-copies">here</a>.</i></p> <br style="clear:both;"/> <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.pheedo.com/click.phdo?s=ffcd43d5a37f870cc042223d264b8c22"><img alt="" style="border:0;" border="0" src="http://www.pheedo.com/img.phdo?s=ffcd43d5a37f870cc042223d264b8c22"/></a> <img src="http://www.pheedo.com/feeds/tracker.php?i=ffcd43d5a37f870cc042223d264b8c22" style="display:none;" border="0" height="1" width="1" alt=""/>

There are 9.8 million registrants worldwide and they've downloaded 170 million files. All in all, PSN has distributed 86 peta bytes of data worth something like 17 million (single layer) DVDs (read: not Blu-ray discs). Now think about those 17 million DVDs stacked in a big, stinky pile and tell us with a straight face that digital distribution, despite how much we love our pretentious vinyl collection and ripping our own CDs, is not progress that will make for a better world.

How many bricks have been produced <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://gizmodo.com/5018990/lego-secret-vault-contains-all-sets-in-history">in history</a>? What's the best-selling set ever? What has been the worst? Do they recycle? How did they survive the crisis that almost killed them? How successful is Mindstorms? What are the actual names of each of the pieces? Why there are no blondes in Lego sets? Why there are extra pieces sometimes? Here's the definitive mega-reference, straight from Lego.</p> <p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://gizmodo.com/tag/legotrip"><img src="http://gizmodo.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/06/legotrip.jpg" align="right" hspace="4" vspace="2"></a>I have organized all your questions in groups: about the company, environment, design, trivia, crazy questions, and the future.</p> <p><b>Trivia</b></p> <p><b>? Why did I always have pieces left over when I built my castle sets? Do they just do that to jack with kids?</b><br> For two reasons: first, because some pieces are so small that they weigh too little to be measured by their scale, during packaging (you will see this when I publish the factory tour. J.) Second, because it's better to have too many of those pieces than have one of them missing. Since we statistically know what pieces may get lost, we include some extras when appropriate.</p> <p><b>? Why there are no blonde minifigs in the regular Lego sets?</b><br> Because they will look bad with the yellow heads. There are blondes, however, in the licensed lines, like Star Wars or Harry Potter.</p> <p><b>? Why aren't Lego figures ever sold separately from the sets?</b><br> Minifigures can be purchased separately on a limited basis. Some of our Lego stores sell the minifigures separately. You can also purchase minifigure pieces through Lego.com in the Pick-a-Brick wall. Additionally, there is a set called Community Workers which features nothing but classic minifigures. However, watch shelves in the coming year, you never know what you might find! (What I want to know is where the heck can I buy <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://gizmodo.com/5017950/galactic-empire-cloning-stormtroopers-in-lego-factory">stormtroopers helmets</a> for all my minifigs. J)</p> <p><b>? What do you call the different pieces internally? Any other name beyond bricks, like "flats" for the flat pieces or something similar?</b><br> We refer to the standard pieces as bricks. Flat pieces are either plates (these have studs and are 1/3 the height of a Lego brick) or tiles (these are the flat pieces with no studs). Everything is referred to by its stud count, so a classic Lego bricks is referred to as a 2x4. Carry that out, and you can see there are 1x2s and 2x3s and 1x8s and on and on and on?</p> <p><b>? Why did you change the color palette?</b><br> The color palette changes as our themes change. However, our basic brick colors&mdash;red, yellow, blue, green, black and white&mdash;will always remain as staples in the assortment.</p> <p><b>? Why don't Duplo blocks integrate with Quatro blocks like the regular Lego bricks integrate with Duplo?</b><br> Duplo bricks are indeed compatible with Quatro bricks, just as Lego bricks are compatible with Duplo bricks. Lego provides the only building system that is compatible from birth to collector!</p> <p><b>? I want you to ask the Lego gang for the definitive answer on the plural for Lego bricks. Is it, as we Brits say, simply Lego, or is it, as some Americans insist, Legos?</b><br> Actually both the Brits and the Americans are wrong&mdash;but are all forgiven! ?Lego? is an adjective and is not meant to be a standalone name. It should always be Lego bricks, Lego building, Lego products, etc.</p> <p><b>? Why there are no black minifigs?</b><br> When the minifigure was first introduced 30 years ago, it was given the iconic yellow skin tone to reflect the non-specific and transcendental quality of a child?s imagination. In 2002, as more licensed properties were added to the assortment, the decision was made to introduce ethnic and skin tones more in keeping with the actual characters and personalities who were being replicated. This included the introduction of black minifigures. However, these ethnic minifigures are only used in our licensed sets, all Lego playthemes continue to use the generic yellow face.</p> <p><b>About the company</b></p> <p><b>?How many Lego bricks are produced each year?</b></p> <p>Approximately 19 billion Lego elements are produced per year. 2.16 million are molded every hour, 36,000 every minute.</p> <p><b>? Approximately, how many bricks they've ever made since Lego started to produce them?</b><br> More than 400 billion Lego bricks have been produced since 1958. There are about 62 Lego bricks per person of the Earth?s population.</p> <p><b>? How many Lego sets do they manufacture per year?</b><br> The number of sets varies per time of year and per year. In the U.S., we launch on average 130 new sets per year. Approximately 7 Lego sets are sold every second around the world.</p> <p><b>? How much money do they make per piece?</b><br> Because we have so many specialized pieces, the average cost per piece is difficult to name. For example, a 2x4 Lego brick does not require the complexity to produce as a Lego minifigure or a Lego fence piece. The molds that we use to create Lego elements are very expensive to design and produce.</p> <p><b>? When can we buy ANY Lego element on shop.Lego.com (and maybe get recommended replacement suggestions if they are not available). If I will pay $300+ for a GREAT Lego Technic model used on eBay, I certainly would have no problems dropping the same into one of my own creations?</b><br> We are always working to improve the assortment of pieces available through our Pick a Brick service. Right now we have over 900 elements available. Unlike the traditional toy retail business, it?s more difficult for us to project which individual pieces or elements will be in demand in a given time period. For example, we know that kids like Lego sets with wheels. So if a new set has wheels, we look at other sets historically that have wheels to predict the demand. But in an individual brick fulfillment, we have no way to know when someone may decide to build a six-foot monster that is orange, thereby requiring a huge amount of orange bricks. As a result, we currently limit the number of bricks available so that we can maintain healthy inventory and prevent consumer frustration, but also test to see what people want the most on a piece by piece basis.</p> <p><b>? Why is Lego so expensive?</b><br> Quality and safety are the top concerns for the Lego Group. To ensure the best and safest products, Lego bricks are made with the highest quality materials, which does factor into the cost. Using premium materials ensures that the product is not only safe, but that it is durable enough to hand down from generation to generation. [I was told in the factory that their tests show that no bricks have ever decomposed or released any chemical substances. -J]</p> <p><b>? I'd like you to ask the Lego guys, why they don't have all the parts available for order as singletons or in bulk on their web site?</b><br> See above.</p> <p><b>? I'm curious as to why they discontinue series and sets more rapidly now than they did in the past. It used to be that a series could be counted on for multiple years, now it's barely 12 months and they're "no longer produced." Is this marketing? Logistics? Or are trends really changing that fast in their market these days?</b><br> The toy business has become a very fast-paced and competitive world&mdash;almost mimicking the fashion industry in how quickly things come and go as fads. The life of a typical Lego play theme line can range anywhere from one to three years. However, there are certain themes&mdash;like Space and Castle&mdash;that we consider evergreen themes, and those are rotated in and out over the course of a few years. When a theme is a classic, we often maintain the theme, but rotate the new models on a shorter term to maintain novelty and interest in the market.</p> <p><b>? Will Lego sell bulk bricks again?</b><br> The Lego Group has never stopped selling bulk bricks. Our Creative Building buckets and tubs are available at all major and specialty retailers. New boxes of bricks are also available. Additionally, if you?re in the area of a Lego store you can stop at a Pick-a-Brick wall or visit the Pick-a-Brick section of Lego.com.</p> <p><b>? Has the Mindstorm's investment paid off?</b><br> The Mindstorms product line has been an incredibly successful venture for the company. The Mindstorms RIS 2.0 is the #1 selling product in the company?s history, and there are over 1 million RCX bricks that have been sold. Mindstorms NXT, the next generation of the original robotics toolset, also has been very successful.</p> <p><b>? What country buys the most Lego sets per person?</b><br> Germany is the number-one Lego market, in fact, Lego is the number-one toy company in Germany. The top-selling lines in Germany are Lego TECHNIC and Lego CITY. The U.S. is the second largest market, with the top-selling lines being BIONICLE and Lego Star Wars.</p> <p><b>? How did they re-launch the company when it was almost bankrupt?</b><br> As a company we were very lucky to have survived our crisis. We had some very rocky years, but it was our fans who got us back on track. We were trying to do too many things and deviated from what we do best: classic building. To regain our footing, we went back to basics and focused on the brick and those core themes on which our company foundation was built, like City and Castle. We also shed the things that were not related to the toy business&mdash;we licensed out our video game development to the best partners and we sold off our theme parks. Thankfully for us, our fans were patient and welcomed us back with open arms. Fortunately, no matter how much the market changes and kids tastes vary, there will always be room for classic Lego play.</p> <p><b>? What is the best selling Lego set ever made?</b><br> The Lego Mindstorms Robotics Invention System set is the best-selling Lego set ever. Over 1 million of these have been sold globally since their launch.</p> <p><b>? What theme was the worst selling one they have made?</b><br> A few years back, we strayed too far from our core product line when we entered into an action figure line called Galidor. With no traditional Lego construction elements, it proved to be unfamiliar to Lego fans who expect a certain kind of play experience from the Lego brand.</p> <p><b>? What theme is the best seller, excluding Basic sets and town?</b><br> Every country has a different best-seller and as we rotate themes in and out different themes rise to the top. Over the last 50 years we have seen that Town, Space, Castle and Pirates are the evergreen themes that seem to always have a place in the hearts of Lego fans. Right now, Lego CITY is the number-one theme around the world, and other global best-sellers include Lego Star Wars, BIONICLE and Lego Indiana Jones.</p> <p><b>? Why don't they (Lego online shop) ship Lego to Hong Kong?</b><br> We are always looking to extend the reach of our Lego products and where they are sold and shipped. Currently, Lego products are sold in stores in Hong Kong.</p> <p><b>Environment</b></p> <p><b>? What happens to all the bad pieces? Is there a Lego heaven? Do they recycle them?</b><br> Due to the precision of the brick molding machines, there are very few ?bad? pieces&mdash;only 18 elements in every million produced fail to meet the company?s high standards. Extra pieces or pieces from boxes that are caught on the line and identified as missing pieces or have boxes that are slightly damaged are used for donation boxes that are distributed to underprivileged children?s organizations around the world.</p> <p><b>? Why there is no recycling program for all the plastic they produce?</b><br> Lego Bricks are recyclable, just not in the way that most people think of recycling. Lego bricks are one of those things that never break and most people pass them down from generation to generation, thus keeping them alive. Also, during production we recycle all of the residual plastic used. In the molding machines, we crunch any faulty elements and put the granulate back in to the mold. Plastic that we can no longer use is sold to industries that can make use of them.</p> <p><b>? Is the plastic currently used to form Lego the same as it was 20 years ago?</b><br> The plastic is almost the exact same plastic used 20 years ago. Slight changes to the mix have occurred, but the quality has remained the same.</p> <p><b>Design</b></p> <p><b>? How much the tooling costs are? Who makes them?</b><br> The price of a single mold is very high. Most of them are made in Germany.</p> <p><b>? How much is Lego considering the Adult fans vs the children when designing sets?</b><br> When we design sets, we take both children and adults into consideration. Children are our primary audience, especially as it relates to the core play theme sets; however, much of what appeals to children in today?s Lego sets has strong appeal among adult fans as well. With Lego Star Wars, adults are equally considered. In designing any set, it?s about the balance between the building experience and the play experience. We do also leverage our direct to consumer channels to provide ultimate collectors sets, special exclusives, sculptures and models that are designed with skilled builders and adult fans in mind. We sometimes even invite our adult fans to help us design new sets.</p> <p>Mindstorms NXT is a great example of how we worked together with adult fans to determine what the set would include, with a particular focus on ensuring that the end result was as compelling for a child as it was for an adult user. We continually look to our community of both kids and adults to ensure that we are meeting and exceeding expectations.</p> <p><b>? Why did they changed the founders rule to never make gun like elements?</b><br> The company still has a no gun policy when it comes to realistic or military play scenarios. However, in order to stay true to the strong licensed properties we incorporate to the Lego portfolio, we need to stay true to those properties and sometimes that involves including weapons. In our own play themes, some element of good vs. bad conflict is typically considered to provide for role play opportunities. In those instances, the setting is very clearly a fantasy world. (Fortunately, there are third-parties who do this, like the amazing people from <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://gizmodo.com/365757/lego-arms-dealer-sells-everything-from-ak47-to-uzi">Brickarms</a>. J)</p> <p><b>? I would like to know why they are using so many specialized pieces in their sets now instead of using more "basic" bricks that allow for greater building outside the set the pieces came in. Why have Lego sets for the latest few generations been dummied down?</b><br> This is an impression that many people have but, in fact, the piece count has been reduced drastically and there's a move back to roots in Lego, not only for creativity but to save money. Lego went from 12,000 different pieces to 6,800 in the last few years?a number that includes the color variations.</p> <p><b>? Why do they use so many 'cheater' bricks... i.e., instead of stacking 4 1x2 bricks they produced a 1x2x4 brick. Or those HUGE chunks uses for castle walls. Sure it speeds construction, but it reduces creativity/playability.</b><br> Sometimes larger bricks are used to help kids ease into building and help them complete the model faster so that they can get to the play experience. We have learned that there are many different types of builders out there&mdash;some are all about the building experience, but some are about the play experience. We try to balance our portfolio to appeal to both groups.</p> <p><b>? Has the decision to make faces other than the smiley face caused problems in any markets?</b><br> Changing the minifigure faces first happened in 1989 with the introduction of the Pirates line. Since that time, we have had very few questions from consumers. For those Lego purists out there, we have left the original smiley in the assortment so that a familiar face is always there.</p> <p><b>? I would like to know what happened to the good old days of really complex, lifelike models? I have some of the old classics still like the Semi Truck with the pneumatic crane on the back, the JCB Excavator, the all wheel steer sports car, the Ferrari esque car with the 4 speed gearbox... Where did models like this go?</b><br> We still have awesome Lego TECHNIC sets and models that carry extreme levels of detail and functionality. They aren?t always available in the mass retail channels, so you often need to look for them on Lego.com or other specialty retailers.</p> <p><b>? How long do they take to develop a theme, all the sets, start to finish?</b><br> Over the past few years we have been able to dramatically decrease the time it takes to develop and produce a new set. The average development period is now about 12 months from start to finish, down from 2-3 years previously.</p> <p><b>? What's with all the stickers lately? Don't they pre-print anything anymore? And if you have to take the stickers off to disassemble the sets, why not have replacement sheets available on Shop-at-home?</b><br> Certain elements are still pre-printed; however, we find that the stickers allow for even more details and more realism in any given set. We understand that it can be frustrating sometimes, and encourage anyone with questions to contact our Consumer Services department.</p> <p><b>Crazy questions</b></p> <p><b>? Any plan to sell real-life brick-size Lego pieces? I want to build an actual house.</b><br> We have no plans at this time to sell real-life brick-size Lego pieces. You?ll just have to build your house of normal materials for the time being.</p> <p><b>? Why do Lego look so delicious but taste so bad?</b><br> As your parents probably told you when you were young, there are some things that shouldn?t be eaten. Lego bricks are one of them. Please keep them away from your mouth.</p> <p><b>? Are bricks available in truly staggering quantities, for artists wishing to explore the possibilities of Lego as a medium for large scale sculpture?</b><br> We always encourage creativity and love our Lego artists. Unfortunately at this time we don?t have a system put in place to sell staggering quantities. Pick-A-Brick and buckets and tubs are the best solution for those looking for large quantities of classic bricks.</p> <p><b>? Where can I buy a legit golf shirt with the Lego logo embroidered on it?</b><br> Lego shirts tend to come in and out of the assortment. Currently, we do not have a golf shirt in the assortment, but keep checking back!</p> <p><b>? When will Lego?s produce a beer stein kit complete with a tap?</b><br> We love your creativity, but the Lego Group probably won?t be producing a beer stein kit in the near or distant future; however, if you are so inclined, you can design your own on LegoFactory.com.</p> <p><b>The future</b></p> <p><b>? Any plans to refresh old sets like Blacktron or the monorail?</b><br> We are constantly looking back at the past to help shape the sets of the future. As of now there are no plans to refresh these sets, but what?s to come is always a mystery.</p> <p><b>? Would you include Mindstorm technology in normal Lego sets?</b><br> In 2007 we introduced the Lego Power Function system, which allows models to come to life using motors and sensors without the programming feature of Mindstorms. For those looking to combine Lego building with Mindstorms technology everything is compatible.</p> <p><b>? Why don't you use LEDs?</b><br> Currently we do not use LEDs, but our designers are always coming up with new and exciting ways to enhance the building experience.</p> <p><b>? I know you do Lego Ferris wheels, but have you ever consider a Lego roller coaster?</b><br> In deciding what products will go to market, there are numerous factors that we have to consider. As a global company, we try to pick products that have global appeal. We also look for models that have the best building and play experience. Our model designers are always coming up with new and great ideas, roller coasters may be included in that, it?s just a matter of making sure it works in the current assortment.</p> <p><b>? Would you consider doing Lego sets based on famous history scenes, for education?</b><br> Anything is a possibility with the Lego System. We have created models of famous landmarks, like the Statue of Liberty and the Eiffel Tower, and we have an Education division that is always coming up with new ideas. But if you don?t want to wait for this one to surface, there?s always Lego Factory where you can design and build your own historic scenes.</p> <p><b>? I really wish they weren't discontinuing their 9V electrified rail train sets. My question is why?</b><br> As a company, we are very focused on the core bricks and developing the ?system of play.? With the recent development of the Lego Power System, we are able to replace several non compatible applications with one electric system. Unfortunately, this means that we are moving from two systems with trains to one coherent system.</p> <p><b>? Will Lego continue to reach out to a more adult audience with more intricate and larger sets?</b><br> Our adult audience is very important to us and we will continue to produce the larger, more intricate sets, which are typically found in our direct to consumer channels and other specialty retailers. The latest introduction is the Lego Star Wars Death Star.</p> <p><b>? Where are the clear Lego? Glow-in-the-dark? Recycled? Corn Plastic? Rubber? LED Illuminated? Rustic?</b><br> New products and elements are always in development. We have had glow-in-the dark parts in several sets in the last few years, and we also have light bricks in select sets. We use rubber to produce Lego tires&mdash;did you know we?re the world?s largest producer of vehicle tires?</p> <p><b>? When will the 9v train tracks and motors be coming back to factory?</b><br> Unfortunately, the 9v train tracks are being phased out and we are moving toward a more coherent system using the Lego Power System.</p> <p><b>? Does Lego have plans for Wi-Fi connections for Mindstorm?</b><br> Mindstorms NXT includes Bluetooth capability for wireless communication and downloads.</p> <p><b>? Will Lego produce trikes and the old bikes again?</b><br> As of now there are no plans to produce trikes and old bikes.</p> <p>We have a very strong licensing department who are always working with leading manufacturers to identify new categories and products that can carry the Lego brand name.</p> <p><b>? When will the new train sets be introduced?</b><br> Our designers, as well as some faithful fans are working hard to get the new trains ready for market. We expect that these sets will be on sale in 2009. More details to follow!</p> <p><b>? Why don't we get the serious RC stuff in the US?</b><br> RC models are available in the U.S. Check your local retailer, or visit the Lego shop.</p> <p><b>? i just started to get into the Lego trains and purchased the remote control set with extra tracks...now they are not available! There was talk of a new series of trains but I can't find the reference now. The question is simply: what's the plan for Lego train sets?</b><br> See question above</p> <p><b>? Why won't they bring back for good the space theme?</b><br> The space theme is an evergreen theme for us. We currently have Lego Star Wars and Lego Mars Mission themes to satisfy consumer demand for space themed building.</p> <p><b>? Are there any chances that Lego will ever start producing modern day warfare Lego, with tanks and helicopters and what not?</b><br> We have a strict policy regarding military models, and therefore, we do not produce tanks, helicopters, etc. While we always support the men and women who serve their country, we prefer to keep the play experiences we provide for children in the realm of fantasy.</p> <p><b>? Could you ask them if they plan to do another Star Wars robots Mindstorms set please?</b><br> As of now there are no plans to come out with a new Star Wars robot kit; however, we encourage all of our fans to create their own.</p> <p><b>? I am a major fan of the Star Wars Lego, I have the Death Star on my coffee table, and I was wondering I they were ever going to make models based on the expanded universe?</b><br> With the Star Wars franchise, anything is possible! Keeps your eyes open for exciting new things.</p> <p><b>? When are they going to be releasing an advanced model of the Batman rambler?</b><br> As of now there are no plans to release this model.</p> <p>Thanks to all the readers who submitted all these questions.

Here's the definitive mega-reference, straight from Lego.</p> <p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://gizmodo.com/tag/legotrip"><img src="http://gizmodo.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/06/legotrip.jpg" align="right" hspace="4" vspace="2"></a>I have organized all your questions in groups: about the company, environment, design, trivia, crazy questions, and the future.</p> <p><b>Trivia</b></p> <p><b>? Why did I always have pieces left over when I built my castle sets? Do they just do that to jack with kids?</b><br> For two reasons: first, because some pieces are so small that they weigh too little to be measured by their scale, during packaging (you will see this when I publish the factory tour. J.) Second, because it's better to have too many of those pieces than have one of them missing. Since we statistically know what pieces may get lost, we include some extras when appropriate.</p> <p><b>? Why there are no blonde minifigs in the regular Lego sets?</b><br> Because they will look bad with the yellow heads. There are blondes, however, in the licensed lines, like Star Wars or Harry Potter.</p> <p><b>? Why aren't Lego figures ever sold separately from the sets?</b><br> Minifigures can be purchased separately on a limited basis. Some of our Lego stores sell the minifigures separately. You can also purchase minifigure pieces through Lego.com in the Pick-a-Brick wall. Additionally, there is a set called Community Workers which features nothing but classic minifigures. However, watch shelves in the coming year, you never know what you might find! (What I want to know is where the heck can I buy <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://gizmodo.com/5017950/galactic-empire-cloning-stormtroopers-in-lego-factory">stormtroopers helmets</a> for all my minifigs. J)</p> <p><b>? What do you call the different pieces internally? Any other name beyond bricks, like "flats" for the flat pieces or something similar?</b><br> We refer to the standard pieces as bricks. Flat pieces are either plates (these have studs and are 1/3 the height of a Lego brick) or tiles (these are the flat pieces with no studs). Everything is referred to by its stud count, so a classic Lego bricks is referred to as a 2x4. Carry that out, and you can see there are 1x2s and 2x3s and 1x8s and on and on and on?</p> <p><b>? Why did you change the color palette?</b><br> The color palette changes as our themes change. However, our basic brick colors&mdash;red, yellow, blue, green, black and white&mdash;will always remain as staples in the assortment.</p> <p><b>? Why don't Duplo blocks integrate with Quatro blocks like the regular Lego bricks integrate with Duplo?</b><br> Duplo bricks are indeed compatible with Quatro bricks, just as Lego bricks are compatible with Duplo bricks. Lego provides the only building system that is compatible from birth to collector!</p> <p><b>? I want you to ask the Lego gang for the definitive answer on the plural for Lego bricks. Is it, as we Brits say, simply Lego, or is it, as some Americans insist, Legos?</b><br> Actually both the Brits and the Americans are wrong&mdash;but are all forgiven! ?Lego? is an adjective and is not meant to be a standalone name. It should always be Lego bricks, Lego building, Lego products, etc.</p> <p><b>? Why there are no black minifigs?</b><br> When the minifigure was first introduced 30 years ago, it was given the iconic yellow skin tone to reflect the non-specific and transcendental quality of a child?s imagination. In 2002, as more licensed properties were added to the assortment, the decision was made to introduce ethnic and skin tones more in keeping with the actual characters and personalities who were being replicated. This included the introduction of black minifigures. However, these ethnic minifigures are only used in our licensed sets, all Lego playthemes continue to use the generic yellow face.</p> <p><b>About the company</b></p> <p><b>?How many Lego bricks are produced each year?</b></p> <p>Approximately 19 billion Lego elements are produced per year. 2.16 million are molded every hour, 36,000 every minute.</p> <p><b>? Approximately, how many bricks they've ever made since Lego started to produce them?</b><br> More than 400 billion Lego bricks have been produced since 1958. There are about 62 Lego bricks per person of the Earth?s population.</p> <p><b>? How many Lego sets do they manufacture per year?</b><br> The number of sets varies per time of year and per year. In the U.S., we launch on average 130 new sets per year. Approximately 7 Lego sets are sold every second around the world.</p> <p><b>? How much money do they make per piece?</b><br> Because we have so many specialized pieces, the average cost per piece is difficult to name. For example, a 2x4 Lego brick does not require the complexity to produce as a Lego minifigure or a Lego fence piece. The molds that we use to create Lego elements are very expensive to design and produce.</p> <p><b>? When can we buy ANY Lego element on shop.Lego.com (and maybe get recommended replacement suggestions if they are not available). If I will pay $300+ for a GREAT Lego Technic model used on eBay, I certainly would have no problems dropping the same into one of my own creations?</b><br> We are always working to improve the assortment of pieces available through our Pick a Brick service. Right now we have over 900 elements available. Unlike the traditional toy retail business, it?s more difficult for us to project which individual pieces or elements will be in demand in a given time period. For example, we know that kids like Lego sets with wheels. So if a new set has wheels, we look at other sets historically that have wheels to predict the demand. But in an individual brick fulfillment, we have no way to know when someone may decide to build a six-foot monster that is orange, thereby requiring a huge amount of orange bricks. As a result, we currently limit the number of bricks available so that we can maintain healthy inventory and prevent consumer frustration, but also test to see what people want the most on a piece by piece basis.</p> <p><b>?

It used to be that a series could be counted on for multiple years, now it's barely 12 months and they're "no longer produced." Is this marketing? Logistics? Or are trends really changing that fast in their market these days?</b><br> The toy business has become a very fast-paced and competitive world&mdash;almost mimicking the fashion industry in how quickly things come and go as fads. The life of a typical Lego play theme line can range anywhere from one to three years. However, there are certain themes&mdash;like Space and Castle&mdash;that we consider evergreen themes, and those are rotated in and out over the course of a few years. When a theme is a classic, we often maintain the theme, but rotate the new models on a shorter term to maintain novelty and interest in the market.</p> <p><b>? Will Lego sell bulk bricks again?</b><br> The Lego Group has never stopped selling bulk bricks. Our Creative Building buckets and tubs are available at all major and specialty retailers. New boxes of bricks are also available. Additionally, if you?re in the area of a Lego store you can stop at a Pick-a-Brick wall or visit the Pick-a-Brick section of Lego.com.</p> <p><b>? Has the Mindstorm's investment paid off?</b><br> The Mindstorms product line has been an incredibly successful venture for the company. The Mindstorms RIS 2.0 is the #1 selling product in the company?s history, and there are over 1 million RCX bricks that have been sold. Mindstorms NXT, the next generation of the original robotics toolset, also has been very successful.</p> <p><b>? What country buys the most Lego sets per person?</b><br> Germany is the number-one Lego market, in fact, Lego is the number-one toy company in Germany. The top-selling lines in Germany are Lego TECHNIC and Lego CITY. The U.S. is the second largest market, with the top-selling lines being BIONICLE and Lego Star Wars.</p> <p><b>? How did they re-launch the company when it was almost bankrupt?</b><br> As a company we were very lucky to have survived our crisis. We had some very rocky years, but it was our fans who got us back on track. We were trying to do too many things and deviated from what we do best: classic building. To regain our footing, we went back to basics and focused on the brick and those core themes on which our company foundation was built, like City and Castle. We also shed the things that were not related to the toy business&mdash;we licensed out our video game development to the best partners and we sold off our theme parks. Thankfully for us, our fans were patient and welcomed us back with open arms. Fortunately, no matter how much the market changes and kids tastes vary, there will always be room for classic Lego play.</p> <p><b>? What is the best selling Lego set ever made?</b><br> The Lego Mindstorms Robotics Invention System set is the best-selling Lego set ever. Over 1 million of these have been sold globally since their launch.</p> <p><b>? What theme was the worst selling one they have made?</b><br> A few years back, we strayed too far from our core product line when we entered into an action figure line called Galidor. With no traditional Lego construction elements, it proved to be unfamiliar to Lego fans who expect a certain kind of play experience from the Lego brand.</p> <p><b>? What theme is the best seller, excluding Basic sets and town?</b><br> Every country has a different best-seller and as we rotate themes in and out different themes rise to the top. Over the last 50 years we have seen that Town, Space, Castle and Pirates are the evergreen themes that seem to always have a place in the hearts of Lego fans. Right now, Lego CITY is the number-one theme around the world, and other global best-sellers include Lego Star Wars, BIONICLE and Lego Indiana Jones.</p> <p><b>? Why don't they (Lego online shop) ship Lego to Hong Kong?</b><br> We are always looking to extend the reach of our Lego products and where they are sold and shipped. Currently, Lego products are sold in stores in Hong Kong.</p> <p><b>Environment</b></p> <p><b>? What happens to all the bad pieces? Is there a Lego heaven? Do they recycle them?</b><br> Due to the precision of the brick molding machines, there are very few ?bad? pieces&mdash;only 18 elements in every million produced fail to meet the company?s high standards. Extra pieces or pieces from boxes that are caught on the line and identified as missing pieces or have boxes that are slightly damaged are used for donation boxes that are distributed to underprivileged children?s organizations around the world.</p> <p><b>? Why there is no recycling program for all the plastic they produce?</b><br> Lego Bricks are recyclable, just not in the way that most people think of recycling. Lego bricks are one of those things that never break and most people pass them down from generation to generation, thus keeping them alive. Also, during production we recycle all of the residual plastic used. In the molding machines, we crunch any faulty elements and put the granulate back in to the mold. Plastic that we can no longer use is sold to industries that can make use of them.</p> <p><b>? Is the plastic currently used to form Lego the same as it was 20 years ago?</b><br> The plastic is almost the exact same plastic used 20 years ago. Slight changes to the mix have occurred, but the quality has remained the same.</p> <p><b>Design</b></p> <p><b>? How much the tooling costs are? Who makes them?</b><br> The price of a single mold is very high. Most of them are made in Germany.</p> <p><b>? How much is Lego considering the Adult fans vs the children when designing sets?</b><br> When we design sets, we take both children and adults into consideration. Children are our primary audience, especially as it relates to the core play theme sets; however, much of what appeals to children in today?s Lego sets has strong appeal among adult fans as well. With Lego Star Wars, adults are equally considered. In designing any set, it?s about the balance between the building experience and the play experience. We do also leverage our direct to consumer channels to provide ultimate collectors sets, special exclusives, sculptures and models that are designed with skilled builders and adult fans in mind. We sometimes even invite our adult fans to help us design new sets.</p> <p>Mindstorms NXT is a great example of how we worked together with adult fans to determine what the set would include, with a particular focus on ensuring that the end result was as compelling for a child as it was for an adult user. We continually look to our community of both kids and adults to ensure that we are meeting and exceeding expectations.</p> <p><b>? Why did they changed the founders rule to never make gun like elements?</b><br> The company still has a no gun policy when it comes to realistic or military play scenarios. However, in order to stay true to the strong licensed properties we incorporate to the Lego portfolio, we need to stay true to those properties and sometimes that involves including weapons. In our own play themes, some element of good vs. bad conflict is typically considered to provide for role play opportunities. In those instances, the setting is very clearly a fantasy world. (Fortunately, there are third-parties who do this, like the amazing people from <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://gizmodo.com/365757/lego-arms-dealer-sells-everything-from-ak47-to-uzi">Brickarms</a>. J)</p> <p><b>? I would like to know why they are using so many specialized pieces in their sets now instead of using more "basic" bricks that allow for greater building outside the set the pieces came in. Why have Lego sets for the latest few generations been dummied down?</b><br> This is an impression that many people have but, in fact, the piece count has been reduced drastically and there's a move back to roots in Lego, not only for creativity but to save money. Lego went from 12,000 different pieces to 6,800 in the last few years?a number that includes the color variations.</p> <p><b>? Why do they use so many 'cheater' bricks... i.e., instead of stacking 4 1x2 bricks they produced a 1x2x4 brick. Or those HUGE chunks uses for castle walls. Sure it speeds construction, but it reduces creativity/playability.</b><br> Sometimes larger bricks are used to help kids ease into building and help them complete the model faster so that they can get to the play experience. We have learned that there are many different types of builders out there&mdash;some are all about the building experience, but some are about the play experience. We try to balance our portfolio to appeal to both groups.</p> <p><b>? Has the decision to make faces other than the smiley face caused problems in any markets?</b><br> Changing the minifigure faces first happened in 1989 with the introduction of the Pirates line. Since that time, we have had very few questions from consumers. For those Lego purists out there, we have left the original smiley in the assortment so that a familiar face is always there.</p> <p><b>? I would like to know what happened to the good old days of really complex, lifelike models? I have some of the old classics still like the Semi Truck with the pneumatic crane on the back, the JCB Excavator, the all wheel steer sports car, the Ferrari esque car with the 4 speed gearbox... Where did models like this go?</b><br> We still have awesome Lego TECHNIC sets and models that carry extreme levels of detail and functionality. They aren?t always available in the mass retail channels, so you often need to look for them on Lego.com or other specialty retailers.</p> <p><b>? How long do they take to develop a theme, all the sets, start to finish?</b><br> Over the past few years we have been able to dramatically decrease the time it takes to develop and produce a new set. The average development period is now about 12 months from start to finish, down from 2-3 years previously.</p> <p><b>? What's with all the stickers lately? Don't they pre-print anything anymore? And if you have to take the stickers off to disassemble the sets, why not have replacement sheets available on Shop-at-home?</b><br> Certain elements are still pre-printed; however, we find that the stickers allow for even more details and more realism in any given set. We understand that it can be frustrating sometimes, and encourage anyone with questions to contact our Consumer Services department.</p> <p><b>Crazy questions</b></p> <p><b>? Any plan to sell real-life brick-size Lego pieces? I want to build an actual house.</b><br> We have no plans at this time to sell real-life brick-size Lego pieces. You?ll just have to build your house of normal materials for the time being.</p> <p><b>? Why do Lego look so delicious but taste so bad?</b><br> As your parents probably told you when you were young, there are some things that shouldn?t be eaten. Lego bricks are one of them. Please keep them away from your mouth.</p> <p><b>? Are bricks available in truly staggering quantities, for artists wishing to explore the possibilities of Lego as a medium for large scale sculpture?</b><br> We always encourage creativity and love our Lego artists. Unfortunately at this time we don?t have a system put in place to sell staggering quantities. Pick-A-Brick and buckets and tubs are the best solution for those looking for large quantities of classic bricks.</p> <p><b>? Where can I buy a legit golf shirt with the Lego logo embroidered on it?</b><br> Lego shirts tend to come in and out of the assortment. Currently, we do not have a golf shirt in the assortment, but keep checking back!</p> <p><b>? When will Lego?s produce a beer stein kit complete with a tap?</b><br> We love your creativity, but the Lego Group probably won?t be producing a beer stein kit in the near or distant future; however, if you are so inclined, you can design your own on LegoFactory.com.</p> <p><b>The future</b></p> <p><b>? Any plans to refresh old sets like Blacktron or the monorail?</b><br> We are constantly looking back at the past to help shape the sets of the future. As of now there are no plans to refresh these sets, but what?s to come is always a mystery.</p> <p><b>? Would you include Mindstorm technology in normal Lego sets?</b><br> In 2007 we introduced the Lego Power Function system, which allows models to come to life using motors and sensors without the programming feature of Mindstorms. For those looking to combine Lego building with Mindstorms technology everything is compatible.</p> <p><b>? Why don't you use LEDs?</b><br> Currently we do not use LEDs, but our designers are always coming up with new and exciting ways to enhance the building experience.</p> <p><b>? I know you do Lego Ferris wheels, but have you ever consider a Lego roller coaster?</b><br> In deciding what products will go to market, there are numerous factors that we have to consider. As a global company, we try to pick products that have global appeal. We also look for models that have the best building and play experience. Our model designers are always coming up with new and great ideas, roller coasters may be included in that, it?s just a matter of making sure it works in the current assortment.</p> <p><b>? Would you consider doing Lego sets based on famous history scenes, for education?</b><br> Anything is a possibility with the Lego System. We have created models of famous landmarks, like the Statue of Liberty and the Eiffel Tower, and we have an Education division that is always coming up with new ideas. But if you don?t want to wait for this one to surface, there?s always Lego Factory where you can design and build your own historic scenes.</p> <p><b>? I really wish they weren't discontinuing their 9V electrified rail train sets. My question is why?</b><br> As a company, we are very focused on the core bricks and developing the ?system of play.? With the recent development of the Lego Power System, we are able to replace several non compatible applications with one electric system. Unfortunately, this means that we are moving from two systems with trains to one coherent system.</p> <p><b>? Will Lego continue to reach out to a more adult audience with more intricate and larger sets?</b><br> Our adult audience is very important to us and we will continue to produce the larger, more intricate sets, which are typically found in our direct to consumer channels and other specialty retailers. The latest introduction is the Lego Star Wars Death Star.</p> <p><b>? Where are the clear Lego? Glow-in-the-dark? Recycled? Corn Plastic? Rubber? LED Illuminated? Rustic?</b><br> New products and elements are always in development. We have had glow-in-the dark parts in several sets in the last few years, and we also have light bricks in select sets. We use rubber to produce Lego tires&mdash;did you know we?re the world?s largest producer of vehicle tires?</p> <p><b>? When will the 9v train tracks and motors be coming back to factory?</b><br> Unfortunately, the 9v train tracks are being phased out and we are moving toward a more coherent system using the Lego Power System.</p> <p><b>? Does Lego have plans for Wi-Fi connections for Mindstorm?</b><br> Mindstorms NXT includes Bluetooth capability for wireless communication and downloads.</p> <p><b>? Will Lego produce trikes and the old bikes again?</b><br> As of now there are no plans to produce trikes and old bikes.</p> <p>We have a very strong licensing department who are always working with leading manufacturers to identify new categories and products that can carry the Lego brand name.</p> <p><b>? When will the new train sets be introduced?</b><br> Our designers, as well as some faithful fans are working hard to get the new trains ready for market. We expect that these sets will be on sale in 2009. More details to follow!</p> <p><b>? Why don't we get the serious RC stuff in the US?</b><br> RC models are available in the U.S. Check your local retailer, or visit the Lego shop.</p> <p><b>? i just started to get into the Lego trains and purchased the remote control set with extra tracks...now they are not available! There was talk of a new series of trains but I can't find the reference now. The question is simply: what's the plan for Lego train sets?</b><br> See question above</p> <p><b>? Why won't they bring back for good the space theme?</b><br> The space theme is an evergreen theme for us. We currently have Lego Star Wars and Lego Mars Mission themes to satisfy consumer demand for space themed building.</p> <p><b>? Are there any chances that Lego will ever start producing modern day warfare Lego, with tanks and helicopters and what not?</b><br> We have a strict policy regarding military models, and therefore, we do not produce tanks, helicopters, etc. While we always support the men and women who serve their country, we prefer to keep the play experiences we provide for children in the realm of fantasy.</p> <p><b>? Could you ask them if they plan to do another Star Wars robots Mindstorms set please?</b><br> As of now there are no plans to come out with a new Star Wars robot kit; however, we encourage all of our fans to create their own.</p> <p><b>? I am a major fan of the Star Wars Lego, I have the Death Star on my coffee table, and I was wondering I they were ever going to make models based on the expanded universe?</b><br> With the Star Wars franchise, anything is possible! Keeps your eyes open for exciting new things.</p> <p><b>? When are they going to be releasing an advanced model of the Batman rambler?</b><br> As of now there are no plans to release this model.</p> <p>Thanks to all the readers who submitted all these questions. Please note that some of the questions you sent about licenses were not included because the Lego people are as secretive about their future products as Apple is.

Sony today presented a series of new initiatives designed to build on its previous<br> three-year revitalization plan and to position the company as the leading global provider of<br> networked consumer electronics and entertainment. In particular, the company will focus on<br> strengthening core businesses, enhancing network initiatives and leveraging international growth<br> opportunities to build for the future and drive further growth and profits. In addition, Sony<br> announced the following key mid-term goals:</p> <p>Expand our PC, Blu-ray DiscTM-related products and component/semiconductor businesses<br> into ?trillion yen businesses**,? joining LCD TVs, digital imaging (digital cameras and<br> camcorders), game and mobile phones and raising the total number of ?trillion yen<br> businesses? to seven.<br> Ensure that 90% of our electronics product categories are network-enabled and<br> wireless-capable by the fiscal year ending March 31, 2011 (?FY2010?).<br> Roll out video services across key Sony products by FY2010, starting with the summer 2008<br> launch on the PLAYSTATIONNetwork.<br> Double annual revenue from BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, China) countries to 2 trillion yen***<br> by FY2010.</p> <p>* Three-year period ending March 31, 2011<br> ** Businesses each generating 1 trillion yen or more of annual sales to outside customers, except for Blu-ray Disc<br> related business which includes intersegment sales<br> *** Includes Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications and SONY BMG MUSIC ENTERTAINMENT as allocated</p> <p>Sony has identified a 5% operating margin as a baseline of profitability to generate cash to<br> continue to lead and innovate. Furthermore we will target an annual return on equity of 10% by<br> FY2010. Sony is also planning to allocate a total of 1.8 trillion yen to invest in and build key<br> businesses and technologies over the next three years.</p> <p>Highlights are as follows:</p> <p>Further Strengthen Our Core Businesses</p> <p>Sony intends to maintain a leading position in its ?trillion yen businesses? (LCD TVs, digital<br> imaging, game and mobile phones) and will focus on expanding its PC, Blu-ray Disc-related<br> products, and component/semiconductor businesses into ?trillion yen businesses? by the end of<br> FY2010. At the same time, we expect to improve the operations of our TV business significantly<br> and implement a variety of cost reduction measures to restore that business to profitability in the<br> fiscal year ending March 31, 2009*, and strive for the global No. 1 position in LCD TVs by<br> FY2010. Of the planned 1.8 trillion yen investment over the next three years, approximately 900<br> billion yen will be allocated towards strengthening core focus areas within components and<br> semiconductors, such as image sensors, batteries, display devices and Blu-ray Disc-related<br> components.<br> 1/3</p> <p>Sony is also promoting the concept of ?open innovation?, whereby we are looking not only inside<br> the company, but outside for technologies that foster innovation. By combing Sony?s inherent<br> technological strengths with external expertise, we aim to accelerate R&D efficiency and enable<br> the company to effectively respond to rapidly changing customer needs and preferences in the<br> network era. Through the creation of new user experiences, strengthening core businesses,<br> driving innovation, and minimizing the environmental impact of its operations, Sony will strive to<br> achieve not only sales volume, but also sustainable and profitable growth.</p> <p>In the Game segment, the two key drivers of new growth are non-game content and services in<br> tandem with enhanced network capability. Sony also expects to achieve profitability in this<br> segment in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2009*, a significant year-on-year improvement due<br> to hardware cost reductions and an enhanced line-up of software titles for PLAYSTATION3<br> (?PS3?). Key Game initiatives are:</p> <p>1. Expand content and services available on the network platform<br> 2. Continue to expand the PS3 customer base through the strength of Blu-ray Disc<br> 3.

Going<br> forward, Sony plans to accelerate business expansion through collaboration and integration, not<br> just within each of the Electronics, Game and Pictures segments, but across the entire Sony<br> Group.</p> <p>Sony will target annual sales of 2 trillion yen in the BRIC countries (including revenues from Sony<br> Ericsson Mobile Communications and SONY BMG) by FY2010, doubling FY2007 sales with<br> annual Electronics segment sales alone slated to grow from 600 billion yen to 1.2 trillion yen<br> during this period.</p> <p>2/3<br> Environmental Initiatives - Green Management 2010</p> <p>?Green Management 2010? is a series of mid-term environmental targets that are guiding the<br> Sony Group in its efforts to help prevent global warming, recycle resources, ensure appropriate<br> management of chemical substances and address a broad range of other environmental issues.<br> Through these initiatives, Sony is striving to achieve an absolute reduction in greenhouse gas<br> emissions, specifically a 7% or greater reduction in CO2 emissions by FY2010 compared to the<br> level of FY2000.</p> <p>Financial Strategies for the Mid-Term</p> <p>In order to generate funds to continue to grow and innovate, Sony has identified a 5 percent<br> operating margin as a baseline of profitability.

Our targeted investment (an<br> aggregate of 1.8 trillion yen by the end of FY2010) will put Sony in a position to drive further<br> growth and innovation over the next three years and beyond. Sony will also target an annual<br> return on equity of 10% by FY2010. Going forward, we will work to deliver a stable, high level of<br> profitability while enhancing shareholder value.</p> <p>The business environment in which Sony operates is changing rapidly and, with the advance in<br> digital technology and broadband networks, technological innovation is moving at a pace never<br> experienced before.

In addition to its all-in-one design, built-in webcam, TV tuner and wireless keyboard and mouse, the selling point here is the custom touch interface created by frog design. Here's why this is not just an imitation iMac.<br> </p> <p><strong>Price:</strong> $1500 (The IQ504, sans TV-tuner, sells for $1300)</p> <p><strong>The Verdict:</strong> The TouchSmart comes with the standard array of features you'd expect in an all-in-one PC&mdash;22-inch widescreen, 2.16 Core 2 Duo Processor, ATSC tuner, 4 GB RAM, 500 GB HDD, 5 USB ports and an SDHC reader. These are all solid features, though not mindblowing. The real hook here is whether or not the touchscreen features are as good as advertised. The short answer is that they're satisfactory within the custom interface, and not so great in the normal Vista environment.</p> <p>The touch interface has a homescreen with a row of giant, oversized tiles up top, and smaller ones underneath that display various widget-like apps. Examples of these apps include a music player, photo browser, movie player, RSS feed, calendar, weather, chess, solitaire, notes, etc... Both rows can scroll fromside to side, similar to that of the iPhone, and tiles can also be exchanged between the top and bottom rows freely.</p> <p>Once inside individual apps, they take advantage of using pan and scroll features for lists and thumbnails. The movie player even has a record feature that lets you create a short movie with the webcam that you can email out when finished. The photo browser lets you perform basic adjustments, or even use the touchscreen to crop your photo.</p> <p>Some apps are better than others. Apps like the photo browser, and weather widget are perfectly suited to the touch interface, because the menus are simple and typing is hardly ever required. The RSS reader and Web Browser are not so great because they both use Internet Explorer as its backbone (you have to enter your RSS feeds as bookmarks in IE). The calendar app is decent if you just want to check your schedule, but you ultimately need the keyboard and mouse to do anything more.</p> <p>And while the touchscreen works well within the interface, trying to control the rest of Vista (Media Center notwithstanding) can be maddening. Buttons and icons in Vista are too small for fingertaps on the screen, resulting in hitting the wrong button, or not hitting anything at all. I basically gave up on navigating Vista with the touchscreen after the first 30 minutes.</p> <p>But even within the interface, though it functions competently, you can't help but feel like it needs a bit more polish. Sure, it looks great, but sometimes its choppy or laggy in reacting to your touch, making it feel less than intuitive.</p> <p>Part of this is due to the fact that the touchscreen isn't a real touchscreen, but rather an IR ring around the front of the monitor that tracks the position of your finger on a 2D plane. When the plane is broken, it interprets that as a mouse click. It isn't microscopically precise, but the big buttons of the custom interface help compensate for that to a degree. While I'm sure this helps keep cost low, It doesn't have the same smooth feel.</p> <p>The Touchsmart IQ506 is a good computer, both in design and features, but is a little rough around the edges when it comes to it's touch features. If you want a kitchen computer that looks nice, functions well with a keyboard and mouse, and has a few neat touch functions to boot, this $1500 machine, or the IQ504, isn't a bad deal. But if you're expecting to be blown away by the touchscreen experience, you may want to hold off.

I still rock XP, and I'm pretty happy with that. Why haven't I switched to Macs? Plenty of reasons, not least of which being that I'm just too smart to switch to a Mac. That's right, I'm <i>too smart</i> for Macs. As Bill Gates's retirement rapidly approaches I figured now is a good time to lay out why I'm loyal to his OS.</p> <p>I grew up with Windows. Although my first computer was a Mac Classic (I was like 3 at the time, and I only used it to play that helicopter game where you have to drop the little man into the horse-drawn hay carriage), I've been using Windows PCs for nearly my entire life, learning how to fiddle with the command prompt in DOS and dealing with the rudimentary pile of crap that was Windows 3.1. I survived Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows ME for a short, painful time, Windows 2000 and now, finally, Windows XP. It hasn't always been pretty (see: Windows ME), but through it all I've figured out every little trick there is to know about running Windows. I'm a monster on Windows.</p> <p>And yeah, while some of those earlier versions were essentially garbage, running Mac as your OS wasn't all that great a choice either, especially before OS X came out. Yes, fanboys, I know you love your Macs and everything, but come on: The OS never really came into its own as a real competitor to Windows until 2001. By then, it was too late for me.</p> <p>And while I used to be pretty into PC gaming, the whole no-good-games-on-Macs thing doesn't bother me so much anymore. It's just that to me, when it comes down to it, the PC just feels more logical. Windows is an OS that feels structured and it makes sense just because I'm used to them. Macs feel more nebulous and more dumbed down, like the corners have been softened to not intimidate your mom when she uses your computer. Well, I like having the corners exposed. I like tinkering in the registry to improve performance, I like being able to really tweak the system at the base level. Windows has its engine exposed, and while it might not always be pretty, if you know what you're doing you really have access to the whole thing. And hardware choices are choices I cherish as are access to plenty of apps. Apple takes pride in hiding everything under the rug and keeping it out of your hands to not let you mess it up. I don't need kid gloves.</p> <p>Furthermore, beyond the OS itself, I hate the cult of personality that surrounds Steve Jobs. I like the soon-to-be-retired Bill Gates way more than Steve Jobs, because the guy cares about more than just making enough money to build a castle for himself out of stacks of $100 bills (not that Bill can't do that). Bill Gates is going to be remembered for seriously impacting the global health climate for the better. After all, the Nobel Prize is named after the dude who invented TNT, but his name is invoked a lot more often for encouraging advancements in science, literature and peace. And chances are, if the Gates Foundation keeps chugging along, Gates may even win a Nobel. Steve Jobs, on the other hand, just makes pretty plastic objects, and when it comes down to it, he seems like kind of a greedy dick. I'm more than happy to not give him any more money.</p> <p>And you know what? Macs are too hip. Oh, look at me! I do graphic design! I wear women's jeans and hang out in coffee shops! I'm a DJ! Well good for you. My computer is not a fashion statement. It's a computer.</p> <p>But really, when it comes down to it, the main reason I still use Windows is this: I'm stubborn and lazy. I don't want to switch because it will amount to admitting that I've been wrong for the last 15 years or so. And it would be just a huge pain to do it even if I swallowed my pride, having to relearn all the shortcuts and commands and little nuances that make an OS tick. I know all those for Windows already. I am just far too lazy to relearn OS X, and I don't care how easy you claim it is. I've made my choice, and I'm sticking by it. At least until I buy my next computer, because I sure as hell don't want to have to use Vista. I mean, I like Windows, but I'm not crazy.</p> <br style="clear:both;"/> <img alt="" style="border:0;height:1px;width:1px;" border="0" src="http://www.pheedo.com/img.phdo?i=f6d41591da537919bef47039023610dc" height="1" width="1"/>
