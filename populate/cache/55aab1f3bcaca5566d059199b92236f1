<p>In this left picture of Ryan and Teresa Valdez Klein, I upload photos (GPS tagged with location and time) in real time from my mobile phone using Shozu, and share it with my network on Flickr, Twitter, Friendfeed, Facebook, and now my blog.</p>
<p>Like some of you, I&#8217;m still fascinated how digital natives interpret media, communications compared to boomers. Me? I&#8217;m in the middle watching it all go down.</p>
<p>Just a few days ago, I compared <a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2008/07/01/who-has-more-data-about-gen-y-facebook-or-the-us-government/">who had more data about my friend Teresa Valdez Klein, Facebook or the US Government</a>. In the comments, it was almost unanimously the US Government, although interestingly enough, most of the data about her in Facebook is opt-in, rather opt-out.</p>
<p>Do you remember the days of taking your black physical rolls of film to Longs or CVS, waiting a few days or hours to get them developed? There were always risks: hoping we didn&#8217;t get an over exposed photo, losing the roll in one&#8217;s purse or backpack, or forgetting to pick them up all together?  For generation Y, that&#8217;s no longer a problem.</p>
<p>Take for example in my recent lunch with <a href="http://teresacentric.com/">Teresa</a> (interestingly I found out that she was in NY the same time I was via Friendfeed) she mentioned her younger siblings were growing up in a world where photos were published instantly to the web from mobile devices &#8211;this is a native activity to them.  </p>
<p>I spoke with my trusted confidant Jennifer Jones (host of <a href="http://www.marketingvoices.com/">Marketing Voices Podcst</a>) yesterday, when it comes to pictures, her son lives in the digital world. I&#8217;ve been to Jennifer&#8217;s beautiful home, which has nicely framed pictures of the family and kids from all stages of their life.  Like any good mother, Jennifer offered her son to take framed family photos off to college. While it&#8217;s often un-cool for any kid to take family photos to college, his honest retort was &#8220;<em>I don&#8217;t need to Mom, I have Facebook&#8221;</em>.  </p>
<p>He went on to explain that Facebook photos were more current and &#8216;real&#8217;. I&#8217;d add that those photos can be transplanted wherever her son goes, as long as he has access to the internet.  Furthermore, they are social objects and assets that are being shared in the nexus of his network, perhaps far more valuable location than &#8216;on the shelf&#8217;.  </p>
<p>We start to see a connection of the physical and digital universe. At first positioned as &#8216;executive desk&#8217; gadgets, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Digital-Frames-Picture-Frame/b?ie=UTF8&#038;node=525460">Digital Frame</a> continues to get more popular.  I personally have no desire for it, and would only accept it as a gift, never buy it.  A few reasons,, to me my sharing is on the web, which I can access from my mobile phone.  Perhaps one of the biggest challenges of these devices is that many are not internet devices, and a majority of them require physical storage changes &#8211;what a hassle.</p>
<p><strong>So where are you when it comes to photos?</strong></p>

Apparently, a chord was struck in this recent post &#8220;<a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2008/06/30/social-software-here-come-the-cms-vendors/">Social Software: Here come the CMS Vendors</a>&#8220;. In summary, the post indicuates that CMS vendors are sniffing the community space, and the comments lit up (you should read them) with vendors from both camps indicating this discussions are happening behind the curtains and hands are extending across the aisle.  I also am getting more briefing requests from traditional CMS vendors, who are anxious to get my take on the many options I listed out. </p>
<p>There&#8217;s a few interesting discussions that spiraled off the post, and I&#8217;d like to highlight some of the interesting ones, there&#8217;s an interesting story developing, these stories segue nicely into each other.</p>
<p><strong>Some enterprises may not be ready for social</strong><br />
First of all, Larry at ZDnet quickly picks up and covers the post: &#8220;<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=9219">Content management software vendors eye social networking</a>&#8220;, and suggests that acquisitions (option two) for CMS vendors makes since.  Larry adds a very important caveat, some organizations and members (internal or external) may not adopt social behaviors.  Our social technographic research indicates that&#8217;s very much the truth, before any brand decide to use these tools, they should start with member behavior, <a href="http://www.forrester.com/Groundswell/profile_tool.html">we&#8217;ve already made some of this data available for free</a>.  Primarily, the main behavior is &#8216;joiner&#8217; although depending on the deployment, it could also be &#8216;creator, critic,&#8217; and certainly &#8217;spectator&#8217;</p>
<p><strong>Some CMS vendors may not be ready for open</strong><br />
To echo that very fine point, Steve, in his thought provoking post &#8220;<a href="http://www.iconnectdots.com/ctd/2008/06/social-publishi.html">Social Publishing Systems: What about We, the Participants?</a>&#8221; asks if &#8220;we&#8221; are ready to take on more social websites, he then also turns the discussion toward the vendors, and asks if they are prepared to accept open technologies despite that they are from rigid command and control legacies. Steve asks: &#8220;Will they embrace OpenSocial? OpenID? Will a focused, open source Drupal vendor like Acquia&#8221; When you think about it, CMS systems are designed for management (control) of content and publishing. Social software, which may have guardrails, tends to focus on sharing, connecting, learning, and self-expression in a very large sandbox.  Most brands will need both.</p>
<p><strong>Existing fragmented social implementations to be a challenge</strong><br />
EMC&#8217;s Len Devanna adds more to the conversation &#8220;<a href="http://lensblog.typepad.com/ebiz/2008/07/social-software.html">Social Software and CMS</a>&#8220;, as you may know, Documentum, a CMS vendor was acquired by EMC a few years back, and makes sense for this IT behemoth.  Naturally, social software has creeped into the employee base (a groundswell) even at this IT vendor shop and Len points out the need for both a mixture of social and CMS systems.  The question remains: at what point to they integrate? Where will social stop and CMS begin? Len is out here in CA, and I look forward to seeing him more often to discuss this issue.</p>
<p><strong>Some features will be bolted on</strong><br />
We think highly of the 451Group, (read comments) and their post confirms it &#8220;<a href="http://blogs.the451group.com/information_management/2008/07/02/social-web-content-management/">Social (Web) content management</a>&#8221; they&#8217;ve been watching this from the CMS perspective for some time (and I&#8217;ve been watching from the white label sonet) and they suggested that some companies like <a href="http://www.vignette.com/us/Products/Community">Vignette</a> and <a href="http://www.clickability.com/products/Social_Media_Features.html">Clickability</a> are further along than realized.  It&#8217;s difficult to tell how truly robust some of those features are from those landing pages, but compared to the some of the advanced features I&#8217;m seeing out of other players, they could be &#8216;bolt on social&#8217; features added to a platform, rather than a truly social experience.  I&#8217;m quite positive a debate in our industry over &#8216;core social platform&#8217; vs &#8216;bolt on social features&#8217; will take place, I plan to participate. </p>
<p><strong>The Big Question: Will they lead with Community or Publishing Features?</strong><br />
Thinking forward, this really is the crux of the issue that each vendor and industry will have to answer.  What will CMS and White Label vendors lead with?  Social features or Publishing Features?</p>
<blockquote><li>Are brands going to be satisfied with CMS systems that &#8220;bolt on&#8221; social features such as ratings, comments, and discussion boards that are added to existing CMS modules?</li>
<li>Or, will they want fully robust community platforms with extensive profiles, people matching, discussion monitoring, member created on the fly modules that integrate CMS publishing modules?</li>
<li>Will CMS vendors &#8220;bolt on&#8221; these social features, or offer truly robust community platforms that integrate CMS features</li>
</blockquote>
<p>As I get closer to this space, I&#8217;ll develop my answer, (<a href="http://www.cmswatch.com/Trends/1277-Web-CMS-versus-Social-Software">read Tony&#8217;s at the CMS watch</a>) but in the meantime, let&#8217;s hash it out in the comments below.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve started some probes on where we could host a community not-for-profit meet &#038; greet at a neutral location in Silicon Valley in a few months, stay tuned.  Or, if you have a venue (you can&#8217;t be one of these vendors) and can hold a day event, please let me know via email.</p>

To echo that very fine point, Steve, in his thought provoking post &#8220;<a href="http://www.iconnectdots.com/ctd/2008/06/social-publishi.html">Social Publishing Systems: What about We, the Participants?</a>&#8221; asks if &#8220;we&#8221; are ready to take on more social websites, he then also turns the discussion toward the vendors, and asks if they are prepared to accept open technologies despite that they are from rigid command and control legacies. Steve asks: &#8220;Will they embrace OpenSocial? OpenID? Will a focused, open source Drupal vendor like Acquia&#8221; When you think about it, CMS systems are designed for management (control) of content and publishing. Social software, which may have guardrails, tends to focus on sharing, connecting, learning, and self-expression in a very large sandbox.  Most brands will need both.</p>
<p><strong>Existing fragmented social implementations to be a challenge</strong><br />
EMC&#8217;s Len Devanna adds more to the conversation &#8220;<a href="http://lensblog.typepad.com/ebiz/2008/07/social-software.html">Social Software and CMS</a>&#8220;, as you may know, Documentum, a CMS vendor was acquired by EMC a few years back, and makes sense for this IT behemoth.  Naturally, social software has creeped into the employee base (a groundswell) even at this IT vendor shop and Len points out the need for both a mixture of social and CMS systems.  The question remains: at what point to they integrate? Where will social stop and CMS begin? Len is out here in CA, and I look forward to seeing him more often to discuss this issue.</p>
<p><strong>Some features will be bolted on</strong><br />
We think highly of the 451Group, (read comments) and their post confirms it &#8220;<a href="http://blogs.the451group.com/information_management/2008/07/02/social-web-content-management/">Social (Web) content management</a>&#8221; they&#8217;ve been watching this from the CMS perspective for some time (and I&#8217;ve been watching from the white label sonet) and they suggested that some companies like <a href="http://www.vignette.com/us/Products/Community">Vignette</a> and <a href="http://www.clickability.com/products/Social_Media_Features.html">Clickability</a> are further along than realized.  It&#8217;s difficult to tell how truly robust some of those features are from those landing pages, but compared to the some of the advanced features I&#8217;m seeing out of other players, they could be &#8216;bolt on social&#8217; features added to a platform, rather than a truly social experience.  I&#8217;m quite positive a debate in our industry over &#8216;core social platform&#8217; vs &#8216;bolt on social features&#8217; will take place, I plan to participate. </p>
<p><strong>The Big Question: Will they lead with Community or Publishing Features?</strong><br />
Thinking forward, this really is the crux of the issue that each vendor and industry will have to answer.  What will CMS and White Label vendors lead with?  Social features or Publishing Features?</p>
<blockquote><li>Are brands going to be satisfied with CMS systems that &#8220;bolt on&#8221; social features such as ratings, comments, and discussion boards that are added to existing CMS modules?</li>
<li>Or, will they want fully robust community platforms with extensive profiles, people matching, discussion monitoring, member created on the fly modules that integrate CMS publishing modules?</li>
<li>Will CMS vendors &#8220;bolt on&#8221; these social features, or offer truly robust community platforms that integrate CMS features</li>
</blockquote>
<p>As I get closer to this space, I&#8217;ll develop my answer, (<a href="http://www.cmswatch.com/Trends/1277-Web-CMS-versus-Social-Software">read Tony&#8217;s at the CMS watch</a>) but in the meantime, let&#8217;s hash it out in the comments below.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve started some probes on where we could host a community not-for-profit meet &#038; greet at a neutral location in Silicon Valley in a few months, stay tuned.  Or, if you have a venue (you can&#8217;t be one of these vendors) and can hold a day event, please let me know via email.</p>

Last night, I had dinner with Sony Electronics President Stan Glasgow and Top Blogger, <a href="http://news.sel.sony.com/electronicsblog/">Rick Clancy who publishes on the Sony Electronics Blog</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Head or Corp Comm spearheading Blogging Efforts</strong><br />
Rick, who is actually the head of Corporate Communications has decided to establish himself in the front (<a href="http://news.sel.sony.com/electronicsblog/wp-content/themes/Source/images/aboutus.html">read his bio</a>) as the lead blogger.  This is unique, as in many cases corp comm folks find the product experts to come front and center in the blogs rather than themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Outreach: Visiting 42 Stores in 40 Days</strong><br />
Now, in many cases, blogs created and run by corporation communications folks tend to be sterile rehashes of press releases, and feature pro-corporate content.  While the Rick&#8217;s blog is certainly squarly on the party line, he&#8217;s doing something that many do not, he&#8217;s getting out in front of the browser and actually meeting customers.  He&#8217;s on a cross country tour to visit 42 stores in 40 days, the goal? to learn from customers at Sony Style stores, and to evangelize their latest offerings such as PlayStation, HDNA, Vaio, DSLR cameras,  Blu-ray players and whatever cutting technology leaps forth.</p>
<p><strong>Taking a closer look at the blogging efforts</strong><br />
I&#8217;m not the only one to enjoy Rick&#8217;s blog, as Heart Interactive&#8217;s CTO Mike &#8220;Glemak&#8221; Dunn proclaims via <a href="http://friendfeed.com/e/d83747be-3d59-f123-cd07-b6aea452a2c6/Having-dinner-with-sony-s-top-blogger-rick-clancy/">Friendfeed</a>: &#8220;i think he&#8217;s excellent - a great example of using a true voice as a corporate blogger - he was good from day 1, a natural - &#8220;.  </p>
<p>I enjoyed how they have a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sonyelectronics/">flickr stream</a> (but should embed flickr pics directly into the post) and have a Google Map Mashup to track his future locations. </p>
<p>While Rick is certainly heading the right way, I made a few suggestions to him over wine, since he&#8217;s incorporating this as live event, I recommended he use Twitter to help pre-announce where he&#8217;s going to be (for example, today he&#8217;ll be in Portland) to help encourage technology early adopters to show up and meet and greet.  Although I didn&#8217;t mention it, uploading pics in real time with Sony Ericson phones as well live streaming from the Vaio line could only help draw the connective tissue.   </p>
<p>Lastly, I just reviewed some of the incoming links to the Sony Blog on Technorati and see that their successful Mommy blogger event was covered by <a href="http://www.the-write-spot.com/2008/04/forget-that-soc.html">an influential mommy blogger</a> &#8211;Rick should link back into the conversation.  </p>
<p><strong>A room full of journalists and one Twitter user</strong><br />
Perhaps it&#8217;s a sign of the time, but the room was filled with journalists from the top newspapers, (this was a press and analyst event) who were scribbling furiously during dinner.  While the quality is by no means a comparison, I was live-tweeting the highlights in real-time, getting feedback from you all, in 140 characters or less <a href="https://twitter.com/account/archive">on my twitter account</a>.  Is it game changing?  Maybe if I took it more seriously, but then again, reporting isn&#8217;t my job.</p>
<p><strong>Sony&#8217;s vitual/real blogging outreach a good model</strong><br />
Good wishes to Rick and the Sony team on their outreach, a good example of social media as an overlay to the real world &#8211;and important story for a company who captures these stories and displays them with digital devices.</p>

I was speaking to a crowded room at Sun Microsystems a few weeks ago, and I posed this question to the room:</p>
<blockquote><h2><center>[Who has more information about Generation Y: Facebook or the US Government?]</h2>
<p></center></p></blockquote>
<p>I polled the room, and there was an overwhelming show of hands for Facebook being the dominant data holder. Next, I gave the example of my friend Teresa Valdez Klein (Pic: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeremiah_owyang/2611148636/">who I just saw in NY last week, and let her know about this upcoming post</a>), who is an avid Facebook user and representative of Generation Y.  She was an original Facebook user, she was a member while still in college. She self-expresses, she connects with others, and gives her opinion on Facebook and <a href="http://teresacentric.com/">her fabulous blog</a>.  </p>
<hr /><strong><br />
Data found in Facebook about Generation Y</strong><br />
If you?re a Facebook friend of hers (I?m fortunate to have this honor) you?ll be amazed at how much information she shares.  What does Teresa list?</p>
<blockquote><p>
<strong>Demographics</strong><br />
Current city of residence<br />
Former college<br />
Dating status and preference<br />
Birthdate (some include day, month, and year)<br />
Political Views<br />
Religions Views<br />
Pictures ?lots of ?em.</p>
<p><strong>Psychographics and Interests</strong><br />
Next, she lists stories, pictures, media and articles that she likes, including some of her own comments<br />
Interests (over 12 items listed for each of the following)<br />
Favorite Music<br />
Favorite TV Shows<br />
Favorite Movies<br />
Favorite Books<br />
Favorite Quotes</p>
<p><strong>Her Conversations</strong><br />
If you&#8217;re connected to her, you can see all the interests that she has by learning from her applications and widgets on her profile page.  Some people put maps to where they&#8217;ve been, ideal characteristics in a mate/job/friends, and learn about where they&#8217;ve recently been on wall comments about parties, travel, birthdays, and other comments from friends.</p>
<p><strong>Her Network Info</strong><br />
Perhaps the most valuable, is that if you&#8217;re a friend with her, you know her social graph. Then she lists all the folks she?s friends with, and if you?re connected to them you can see all of this info.
</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><br />
Data that we know the US Government has about Generation Y</strong><br />
I?m in no position to state what level of detail they have, but here&#8217;s my best guess:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>What does the US Government have?</strong><br />
Demographics including age, sex, where you?ve lived.<br />
Income, Tax information<br />
Recent purchases, loans, mortgages<br />
Marriage status<br />
Travel status from TSA<br />
If you were a person of interest, I&#8217;m sure they could easily focus in on you through ATM, Credit card, and cell phone activity (GPS or Cell location tracking)</p></blockquote>
<hr />
<p><strong>Marketers drool to get this info, where members self-submit to Facebook</strong><br />
The interesting thing is that all of this content was 	<em>self-submitted</em><br />
, and while marketers are hungrily trying to give away sweepstakes and prizes to get you to register, joiners (what Forrester calls those who use social networks) opt in much of this data and more.  Marketers must froth at this opportunity.  </p>
<p><strong>Of course, all of this leads to even more questions:</strong></p>
<blockquote><li>Now the real question is, does the Government have access (and use) the information available from our telecommunications companies, and/or Facebook?</li>
<li>So what?s scarier, the fact that Generation Y and others are willing to share so much online, or the fact that others may have access to this information. </li>
<p>If you&#8217;re a conspiracy theory buff, (I&#8217;m not)

<p><strong>Gap in Generation Ideology: Extroverts vs Introverts</strong><br />
Just yesterday, one of my colleagues (Gen X), who sends pictures of her baby to the local office expressed she didn&#8217;t want to bombard us with photos. I suggested she put her photos on Facebook, as it&#8217;s more of a &#8216;pull&#8217; content strategy than &#8216;push&#8217;.  She said it made sense, bit despite her knowing there are permissions and controls, it still made her uncomfortable for the &#8220;world to see&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Back to you: Who has more information about Generation Y: Facebook or the US Government?</p>

<p>My first presentation to a Forrester client was a total F-up.  I&#8217;m not new to speaking, but presenting in the Forrester style requires a specific style, and as trained speakers, clients pay a lot of money and expect very polished &#8216;performance&#8217;.  </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what happened: I was out in NY, and I wasn&#8217;t fully prepared, I&#8217;d only done a half-ass job of rehearsing the presentation.  I had the wrong date typed on the opening slide, and the client saw it.  Also, I was giving covering for a colleague and doing her speech, therefore emulating her style, and not doing my own thing.  Apparently, the client wasn&#8217;t impressed, and even suggested I was dressed inappropriately, I&#8217;d argue that I was, but the customer is right.  The next week, in the de-brief with the account team, I got a 30 minute well deserved earful, and had to sheepishly apologize and sent them an mea culpa email which I hope they forwarded on to the client.  Fortunately, the relationship with the client is salvaged, and we continue to do work with them, although I probaly won&#8217;t be invited back.</p>
<p>I sadly dwelled on this for a few days, got some support from my colleagues (Josh, Charlene), my boss-boss Cliff Condon was supportive, mentioning to me it was a &#8216;hard-knock&#8217; a good lesson to walk away with.  </p>
<p>So what was I going to do about it? I made a vow to correct this problem: I started to rehearse outloud several times before new presentations (in the car, at home, in the hotel), started to read more materials on how to be a better speaker, and got some internal training and support.  So far, I&#8217;ve given maybe 30-50 presentations since that ill-fated day, each with good-to-great remarks from clients, I&#8217;m confident the things within my control won&#8217;t happen again.</p>
<p>So what did I learn?  Every company, every website, and every individual is going to make mistakes and fall.  What matters is to quickly learn from those mistakes, and improve that it doesn&#8217;t happen again.  It&#8217;s important in the web industry (a rapidly changing one) that we work in environments that accept mistakes as long as they are not repeated again through hard lessons.</p>
<p>The trick is to quickly make mistakes and then rapidly fix them and move on.  So my friends, <em>fail fast</em>.</p>
<p>Now back to you, how have you quickly turned a negative (product, feature, complaint) into a quick positive iteration?</p>

<p><strong>Social Features a Commodity </strong><br />
As I&#8217;ve mentioned time and time again, it&#8217;s a crowded space in the white label social network space due to low barriers to entry, and commodity features, in fact with <a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2007/02/12/list-of-white-label-social-networking-platforms/">80+ vendors</a> (could be 120+ if I counted <a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2007/11/22/list-of-companies-that-provide-community-insights-intelligence-research-and-data/">insight vendors</a> and <a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2007/07/20/list-of-companies-that-provide-collaboration-platforms/">collaboration vendors</a>), there&#8217;s no shortage of those who will throw their hat into the ring.</p>
<p><strong>Overview: Enterprise Content Management Systems</strong><br />
I&#8217;ve started to notice more of the &#8216;traditional&#8217; CMS and Portal players that already have deep footprints into the corporate web teams that are inching into this space.  First, let&#8217;s take a historical view, many of these vendors appeared in the late 90s, they offer easy ways to publish online for corporations, often including advanced review workflows, templates, and staging and dev sites. I&#8217;ve been on the teams (I&#8217;m a former corporate web guy) that have had to implement, manage, or train stakeholders to use these.  Next, in the early 2000-2002 we started to see acquisitions into this space by large ERP players: Microsoft acquired CMS which eventually evolved into Sharepoint, EMC acquired Documentum, and other ERP players such as Interwoven, Vignette, Stellent, IBM&#8217;s Filenet and LotusNotes, edDot CMS, Xerox&#8217;s Docushare, and Saperion started to extend their KM products for public websites.  There&#8217;s a great <a href="http://www.cmswatch.com/CMS/Vendors/">list of these vendors</a> from CMS watch.</p>
<p><strong>CMS Vendors sniffing the social space</strong><br />
Fast forward to 2008.  With the demand and buzz for social network features, or community offerings, these established CMS/Portal vendors recognize the demand, and see opportunity dollars falling through the cracks.  I&#8217;ve started conversations with several of the big players to gauge where they are headed.  Of course, the conversations don&#8217;t end up on this blog (unless they give me permission, or publish first) but it&#8217;s quite obvious where things are headed.  In fact, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/03/03/more-consolidation-in-the-white-label-social-networking-space-mzinga-acquires-prospero/">see my predictions referenced in a recent Techcrunch article</a>. They won&#8217;t be the only ones, we&#8217;re starting to get glimmers of <a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2008/06/03/when-social-media-marries-crm-systems/">social platforms tying to CRM systems too</a> &#8211;integration afoot.</p>
<p><strong>Three Options for CMS Vendors</strong><br />
There are at least three ways these large CMS vendors can head: </p>
<blockquote><p>
1) Develop the features and roll out community suites. Acquire new staff to understand this new world (it&#8217;s a different skill set than CMS rollout and management).  This will involve client side training, consulting, development/design, new metrics packages, and series of recurring support revenue streams.</p>
<p>2) Acquire the successful white social networking vendors that complement their existing offerings.  Find a player that digs deep within Fortune 5000 that offers 100k revenues on first year from a solution sell, and 50k for ongoing support and services. Or either find and easy to use vendor that offers few but broad features, and attached advertising streams and develop a media network.</p>
<p>3) Do nothing.  Some CMS vendors may be content with their current product offerings to client, and don&#8217;t want to jump into a crowded pool and may choose to avoid offering social features to clients.  With third party developers offering widgets and embeddable applications, they actually may not have to.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Four Options for White Label Social Networks</strong><br />
Some of these enterprise class vendors (I&#8217;ll know more when wave report comes out), it&#8217;s likely they will do a few of these, it&#8217;s not exclusive, and will have a strong stance to do the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>
1) Stay independent.  I could call this &#8216;do nothing&#8217; but it&#8217;s not the case. Like the CMS/Portal space in late 90s, some of these vendors will continue to grow and be stand alone companies, who knows, some may actually become publicly traded companies. </p>
<p>2) Start partnerships.  We&#8217;re already seeing some of these companies band together such as Mzinga/Prospero, and now Awareness ties data to Sharepoint, this nods to a direction of working with others, or at least having interoperability.</p>
<p>3) Design for acquisition.  Some white label vendors have thought this through, and are building their software in the platform or language of another traditional CMS company and are making themselves ripe fruits for acquisitions.</p>
<p>4) Develop flexible architectures.  The future of the web is amorphous, therefore some white label vendors will heavily depend on open APIs, Data, and develop or work with widget vendors to let social content be shared and &#8216;fly&#8217; around the web.  Eventually, some of these widget features could easily be embedded into CMS systems, even if they don&#8217;t offer these features.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Four Options for Brands</strong><br />
In our recent forecast report, we predicted that the <a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2008/04/25/forrester-report-global-enterprise-web-20-market-forecast-2007-to-2013/">largest growth spend at the enterprise level for social services and products will be social networks</a>. Brands have a few options:</p>
<blockquote><p>
1) Develop their own social software features.  I know a few brands (despite me suggesting they buy) are extending their home grown CMS systems to add on social features.  For those with large web development teams it makes sense. For others wanting to be fast and flexible, it&#8217;s often not an efficient path.</p>
<p>2) Work with a White Label Vendor.  Many are choosing to rope in these vendors to develop, train, design, and manage these communities, in most cases they sit &#8216;off to the side&#8217; of the corporate website and are not integrated with product pages. Of course, this whole discussion excludes marketing efforts on organic social sites like Facebook, MySpace, etc.</p>
<p>3) Wait for CMS vendors.  Many brands are just toe-dippin&#8217; into the social space, they are not offering community features, don&#8217;t see the point, or have other objectives to fulfill. As a result, they may just wait a few quarters till CMS vendors offer this ability within their existing platforms.  Of course, this comes with risk from deploying too late, or not offering features that meet the needs of community members</p>
<p>4) Do nothing.  In the end, some brands will choose not to engage customers in community sites, for a variety of reasons such as products or services that are sold to resellers and rebranded, deep technology components that are mainly a b2b sell, or lack of vision to embrace customers.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Watch this emerging trend</strong><br />
Where are we now?  We&#8217;re at the very beginnings of this journey, with most white labels being around for just a few years, and the established CMS vendors starting to sniff this sector and gather requirements (many are coming to me) we&#8217;re clearly at the R&#038;D stage, with some banding development teams to enter this space.</p>
<p><strong>Questions that will be need to be answered by this space:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<li>Will CMS vendors be able to adapt to social features into their legacy systems?</li>
<li>Is the demand from client side strong enough for CMS vendors assert flexibility?</li>
<li>How will these commodity social features be monetized, with everyone having them, how will you differentiate?</li>
<li>Will CMS vendors build, buy, or ignore social features?</li>
<li>When will we see existing internal knowledge management systems integrate these features?</li>
<li>Will the small white label vendors start to get friendly with the CMS space and start to develop an exit strategy?</li>
<li>Are white label vendors building their products for easy integration into CMS vendors?</li>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about developing a &#8217;show and tell&#8217; event where both of these vendors can come together for a meet and greet, if I did, would you attend?</p>
<p>Chime in, love to hear you answer these questions I posed above.</p>

<p>The following six lists have been growing, or show remarkable traction, I wanted to call them out since of them may be older.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<strong><br />

When I started this list just last Friday, it had about 8 names on it.  Since then, it&#8217;s grown to over 60 full time professionals at enterprise size (1000+ employees) that are managing social media programs.  Most of the adoption is with the tech industry, with a smattering from media, consumer products, auto and airline.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2008/06/23/ongoing-list-of-social-media-in-the-financial-industry/">2) Finance Industry + Social Media</a></strong><br />
If you&#8217;re in the Financial industry and want to see who&#8217;s doing what, there&#8217;s a small, but growing list of firms engaging social media.<br />
<strong><a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2008/04/26/insurance-industry-explores-social-media-but-nothing-to-write-home-about/"><br />
3) Insurance Industry + Social Media</a></strong><br />
Similiar to the Finance industry, we see patterns of slow adoption, toe-dipping, and the occasional project moving forward to reach customers.</p>

Perhaps one of the passionate group of consumers are auto drivers, it creeps into the lifestyle of the American in so many different ways as well as global impact.<br />

5) A Chronology of Brands that Got Punk?d by Social Media</a></strong><br />
This is the one list of mine that you don&#8217;t want to be on. It lists out brands that have been brand jacked by social media.  Sadly, it continues to slowly grow.<br />

<strong>6) A Complete List of the Many Forms of Web Marketing for 2008</strong></a><br />
This comprehensive list of all the tools available to you to use for your marketing efforts online is a staple for anyone making decisions or handling budgets at their corporations.  I&#8217;m not quite sure what to add to it next year in 2009.

<a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2008/06/20/list-of-social-computing-strategists-and-community-managers-for-large-corporations-2008">1) List of Social Computing Strategists and Community Managers for Enterprise Corporations</a></strong><br />
When I started this list just last Friday, it had about 8 names on it.  Since then, it&#8217;s grown to over 60 full time professionals at enterprise size (1000+ employees) that are managing social media programs.  Most of the adoption is with the tech industry, with a smattering from media, consumer products, auto and airline.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2008/06/23/ongoing-list-of-social-media-in-the-financial-industry/">2) Finance Industry + Social Media</a></strong><br />
If you&#8217;re in the Financial industry and want to see who&#8217;s doing what, there&#8217;s a small, but growing list of firms engaging social media.<br />
<strong><a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2008/04/26/insurance-industry-explores-social-media-but-nothing-to-write-home-about/"><br />
3) Insurance Industry + Social Media</a></strong><br />
Similiar to the Finance industry, we see patterns of slow adoption, toe-dipping, and the occasional project moving forward to reach customers.</p>

Perhaps one of the passionate group of consumers are auto drivers, it creeps into the lifestyle of the American in so many different ways as well as global impact.<br />

5) A Chronology of Brands that Got Punk?d by Social Media</a></strong><br />
This is the one list of mine that you don&#8217;t want to be on. It lists out brands that have been brand jacked by social media.  Sadly, it continues to slowly grow.<br />

<strong>6) A Complete List of the Many Forms of Web Marketing for 2008</strong></a><br />
This comprehensive list of all the tools available to you to use for your marketing efforts online is a staple for anyone making decisions or handling budgets at their corporations.  I&#8217;m not quite sure what to add to it next year in 2009.

<strong><br />
I&#8217;ve selected the two winners, here&#8217;s their submissions:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/kristieconner"><br />
Kristie Connor, a Marketing Consultant</a>, submits on the concept of &#8216;fluidity&#8217;. I like this concept as the corporate website won&#8217;t be the only container of brand and product content but also this content will spread to wherever the conversations flow on the web: Social networks, blogs, friendfeed and wherever else.  She writes the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Corporate websites of the future will be less about canned content and more about fluidity. Meaning, the consumer will demand websites that are connected to the ?users? and ?consumers? personal networks which will promote and instill word of mouth as a best practice for business development and ultimately sales. The infrastructure will be designed in a way that company developed case studies, webinars and such will be replaced by real consumers leaving messages and user created video?s. The back-end will be light and built to accommodate the interactivity of users and social networks. Customer generated content will be ranked higher in search engines and push the website owner to move in the direction to capture mind share.&#8221;</p>
<p>Additionally, this evolution will put the consumer in the driver?s seat which will drive accountability from outside in.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.relevantlyspeaking.com/">Christopher Smith, VP of Digital Media Marketing and the Creative Director at MediaTrust</a> submits an excellent piece highlighting that people, real humans will be front and center, rather than the stock photo and corporate happy talk, I couldn&#8217;t hope and agree more. Perhaps the future holds a &#8216;customized&#8217; social network where people you actually know that work at the company are front and center on the website, or customers that are connected to you on your social graph:</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;Jeremiah, in response to your contest I submit the following:</p>
<p>I actually believe in 5 years the ?corporate website? as we now it will no longer exist. Gone will be the days of the static brochure site, supported by a ?dynamic? sub-branded social community. There will no longer be the ?self-service? document download centers, or the video case study hiding the infomercial inside.</p>
<p>I see the corporate website as hub of individuals that become your first point of contact, and guide you through your search for products, service or support. Consider the example of the Apple Retail Store experience and extend that to the web. You are going to the corporate site for a reason. Even casual browsers to a corporate site have a passive agenda. Virtual corporate ambassadors will assist you in your interaction with the company, blurring the lines of sales, CRM, and support, with the use of chat, video feed, guided browsing, VoIP? the list goes on.</p>
<p>How will this happen in 5 years? I have already begun this work for my company?s new site, and have begun working with our customer experience team from the tech side to insure that we begin building the opportunity today and defining the process in design and test.</p>
<p>And yes, I already have the date in my calendar, and plan on attending as much of the conference as I can. The downside of winning your contest will be that I am required to visit my mother in law if I am Portland.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Doh! Have fun with your mother in law Chris.

<blockquote><p>Hi Jeremiah,</p>
<p>Thanks for your DM. It would be my pleasure to share my story&#8230; one of your tweets (almost two months ago) mentioned your job feed on your site. Feeling quite unsettled in my current position, I click and found what looked to be a perfect job. I fired off my resume and received a call the next day from the hiring manager. After a series of calls and an intense day of interviews, I received an offer! My new job is Web Director at the Association of Corporate Counsel. It&#8217;s a logical step in my career and should involve a good deal of strategy and operations.</p>
<p>I gave my official notice today &#8212; my manager was in a state of shock. I, on the other hand, am so excited to move.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Jonathan Kash<br />
PS Aside from my gratitude for all you do for the community (including the job feed), I certainly owe you a drink! I&#8217;ll be blogging about my experience once the department knows (law firms are such a strange environment).</p></blockquote>
<p>Congrats Johnathan, I&#8217;ll take that drink, red wine is a fav.</p>

While I&#8217;ve been blogging longer than two years (blogspot, 360, etc), the purchase of this domain web-strategist.com has been a milestone, let&#8217;s recap.</p>
<p><strong>By the numbers: A Benchmark</strong><br />
What was the path?  When I started this new blog, according to Technorati, it was ranked in the millions of blogs, last year was 1,708 and today it&#8217;s ranked <a href="http://www.technorati.com/blogs/www.web-strategist.com%2Fblog?reactions">at 540</a> (the lower the better), and has over 10,000 incoming links.  According to Feedburner there are now over 12,000 subscriptions. According to Google Analytics, there are 86,725 Visits, 132,198 Pageviews, in the last 30 days. Wordpress indicates there are there are currently 1,914 posts and 17,017 comments (over the two years).<br />
<strong><br />
Two year Impacts</strong><br />
Despite all this, most of these numbers are meaningless. For each of these metrics, I question the validity of measurement and measurements only make sense if you benchmark against the previous year, which of course, I did: <a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2007/06/20/happy-birthday-to-web-strategistcom/">see last year&#8217;s stats</a>.  What really matters is the impact that blogging has over the industry that I cover, and the <a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2007/08/27/pursuing-the-web-strategy-mission-as-a-forrester-analyst/">jobs it&#8217;s helped me to get</a>.  </p>
<p><strong>My Blog Strategy: How I did it</strong><br />
So enough stat-porn, I&#8217;ll tell you exactly how I did it, giving you all that I learned so you can improve too.  Here&#8217;s how I did it:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<strong>Created focused content</strong><br />
I focused on the topic of making decisions for corporate websites, primarily around social media. It&#8217;s important to find something interesting and unique to discuss, avoid echoing techmeme. When I first started, I tried to be on Techmeme, I just became a small link when someone else would break a larger story.  For some time now, I&#8217;ve avoided being on techmeme, as I&#8217;d rather be original and small rather than larger but just echo.  I also avoid &#8216;blog fights&#8217;, I&#8217;d rather deliver &#8216;how to&#8217; posts an be a resource.</p>
<p><strong>Publish frequently</strong><br />
I published nearly every day, in fact multiple times a day. How&#8217;d I find time to do that I slowly work on drafts (I&#8217;ve over 100 of them sitting in wordpress) and I&#8217;d budget my time in the morning to <a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2007/07/06/pay-yourself-first-and-one-thing-leads-to-another/">pay myself first</a>. (It&#8217;s 430 AM when I write this).</p>
<p><strong>Think of readers first</strong><br />
Make it easy to read. Sure there&#8217;s a lot of text, but I organize it in an easy to scan (yes scan) way by indenting, use horizontal rule (lines) bolding and using indent points. I approached this as more of a resource to busy professionals rather than my personal journal (although I occasionally share personal info in the context of posts). Forrester conducted a survey, if you want to see who reads this blog and why, <a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/about/survey-results-web-strategy-survey-may-2008/">the results are public</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Interact</strong><br />
Join the conversation. Such shallow words that are thrown around now, but it&#8217;s true. I link to whatever else readers would want to learn about (knowing the more I helped them, the more they&#8217;d come back) answer comments on my own blog, and occasionally leave comments on other blogs (I could work on that more). I self reference to older posts, and that helps to tie everything together as the body of work builds on top of itself.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Productized&#8221; content</strong><br />
Developed some unique posts that were mainstay type of posts: my <a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/category/digest/">digest</a>, the many <a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/category/industry-index/">index lists,</a> and the <a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/category/on-the-move/">on the move series</a>.  These help me to manage the industry I cover, have an online archive, make it easy for info-hungry folks, and reduce my time to come up with constant new ideas.</p>
<p><strong>Have Passion</strong><br />
I&#8217;m so lucky that I get paid to do what I love, I think this is one of the most important things to do in life, sadly, it&#8217;s hard to tell when work starts and stops.  Many people thought it was really strange when is started this blog, many said it was a fad, and really didn&#8217;t look down the line.</p></blockquote>
<p>So what&#8217;s the future to hold?  Well for one, I&#8217;m starting to ask people to <a href="http://friendfeed.com/jowyang">follow me on Friendfeed</a>.  Regarding this blog, I&#8217;ve no intentions to stop this pace sharing and learning, thanks for being part of this, it&#8217;s a fun adventure and I learn many new things from being part of the conversation, (from your comments and links) every day.</p>

How&#8217;d I find time to do that I slowly work on drafts (I&#8217;ve over 100 of them sitting in wordpress) and I&#8217;d budget my time in the morning to <a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2007/07/06/pay-yourself-first-and-one-thing-leads-to-another/">pay myself first</a>. (It&#8217;s 430 AM when I write this).</p>
<p><strong>Think of readers first</strong><br />
Make it easy to read. Sure there&#8217;s a lot of text, but I organize it in an easy to scan (yes scan) way by indenting, use horizontal rule (lines) bolding and using indent points. I approached this as more of a resource to busy professionals rather than my personal journal (although I occasionally share personal info in the context of posts). Forrester conducted a survey, if you want to see who reads this blog and why, <a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/about/survey-results-web-strategy-survey-may-2008/">the results are public</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Interact</strong><br />
Join the conversation. Such shallow words that are thrown around now, but it&#8217;s true. I link to whatever else readers would want to learn about (knowing the more I helped them, the more they&#8217;d come back) answer comments on my own blog, and occasionally leave comments on other blogs (I could work on that more). I self reference to older posts, and that helps to tie everything together as the body of work builds on top of itself.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Productized&#8221; content</strong><br />
Developed some unique posts that were mainstay type of posts: my <a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/category/digest/">digest</a>, the many <a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/category/industry-index/">index lists,</a> and the <a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/category/on-the-move/">on the move series</a>.  These help me to manage the industry I cover, have an online archive, make it easy for info-hungry folks, and reduce my time to come up with constant new ideas.</p>
<p><strong>Have Passion</strong><br />
I&#8217;m so lucky that I get paid to do what I love, I think this is one of the most important things to do in life, sadly, it&#8217;s hard to tell when work starts and stops.  Many people thought it was really strange when is started this blog, many said it was a fad, and really didn&#8217;t look down the line.</p></blockquote>
<p>So what&#8217;s the future to hold?  Well for one, I&#8217;m starting to ask people to <a href="http://friendfeed.com/jowyang">follow me on Friendfeed</a>.  Regarding this blog, I&#8217;ve no intentions to stop this pace sharing and learning, thanks for being part of this, it&#8217;s a fun adventure and I learn many new things from being part of the conversation, (from your comments and links) every day.</p>

<p>I attended last year, and was impressed to see all the corporate web leaders (web strategists) attending.  Steve Gehlen for the Internet Strategy Forum, who founded ISF, has done a great service to our industry, in fact, he and I worked together to form the Silicon Valley chapter a few years ago.</p>
<p>We both realize that many of the readers of this Web Strategy Blog would love to attend the ISF conference, so we?re giving away two free tickets.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2008/05/29/carmen-john-and-ajay-on-the-future-of-white-label-social-networks/">Last time, I gave away tickets for Graphing Social Patterns</a> (<a href="http://blog.ogilvypr.com/?p=367">John Bell, a winner rated it 4/5 stars</a>) by running a contest, it worked pretty well, and I?d like to do this again./  The winners will be announced in new blog post and this post will be updated (so bookmark it).</p>
<p><strong>I will be selected two winners who answer the following question:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>1) Question: What is the future of Corporate Websites in 5 years?<br />
I?ll be looking for out-of-the-box thinking, plausibility, and ability to logically connect the dots why and how your 5 year prediction will happen.  </p>
<p>2) Write it clearly and succinctly, points assigned for brevity.<br />
Effective strategists are excellent communicators.</p>
<p>3) What percentage will you attend the conference?<br />
I want to give these tickets to someone who?ll really use it, I encourage you to answer this even if you don?t plan to attend, have fun with it!
</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks for reading, I?m grateful to get enough traction now to reward readers with conference tickets, books, and the ability to network.  Have fun with this, and strut your stuff strategists!</p>
<p><strong>Update June 28:</strong>  I&#8217;d like to thank  Christopher Smith and Kristie Conner for their excellent responses (scroll down) to their vision of the future of the corporate website.  While everyone provided excellent answers, I enjoyed hearing the focus on people from Chris (sites become social) and Kristie&#8217;s notion on &#8216;fluity&#8217; of the future of the corporate website &#8211;it&#8217;ll spread both off domain and aggregate social content.

<p>Here?s Margy?s comment in its entirety, she raises some valid points, and they deserved to be brought up, here?s the comment she just left:</p>
<blockquote><p>
?Your blog entry is days old, so you probably won?t see my post here, but it?s taken me days to calm down from your post to sputter anything back. (Jerimiah, you made me mad!) I?m a Boomer but in no way ready (or financially able) to exit any stage. When did Boomer (hate that term, btw) become a pseudonym for old fogey anyway? Here?s how Boomers described ourselves to each other in an iconic (for the time) book-cum-manifesto, ?The Apartment Book,? dated 1979. Sounds a little bit like the optimistic twenty-something rhetoric of 2008. ?Through most of the seventies [we] struggled to invent and interpret a way of life that did not follow the old patterns. For the first time, because of the radical changes of the sixties, young people were not automatically following their parents? paths to marriage, children and a house in the suburbs. Rather, they were searching, alone or in paris or in groups for a place to live that would express their own values. The community of young people who were, by God, going to live their own brand of life ? even if they weren?t so sure what it was yet. Because we come from various persuasions and backgrounds, we approach our subject matter with new eyes. The only discipline is a shared commitment to making real ideas happen, without ?hype or the tyranny of status names.? </p>
<p>I still believe that. And I bet if you went back further and checked on contemporaneous advertising and magazines targeting young college graduates of the early 1950?s post-war generation just entering the workplace, you?d again find that same open-eyed wonder at the opportunities before them. </p>
<p>The ready-for-anything attitude you describe can?t be pigeonholed into tired marketing classifications like Gen X or Gen Y. It doesn?t come and go like actors on a stage or styles in fashion. It?s something that, if we?re lucky, attacks us early and stays with us throughout our lives.? </p></blockquote>
<p>First of all, I?m sorry for offending you, I sincerely mean that, that was never my intent.  </p>
<p>Secondly, the post is based off data, and my duties in my day job, as it?s an accurate observation of what is, and what will happen.  In fact, I?m working on a Forrester report looking at how boomers use social media (coming in the next few weeks) so this is top of mind.  </p>
<p>As an analyst, it?s my job to categorize, segment, and describe trends, and for what it?s worth we didn?t create the ?boomers? classification.  </p>
<p>Regardless, Forrester classifies the Boomer generations in two segments, Younger Boomers (42-51) Older Boomers (52-62).  My previous post was obviously referring to the older boomers, and I?ll suspect that you Margy are of the younger group.</p>
<p>These aren?t pigeon holes, and nor are they intended to de-personalize the individual.  They are useful for those who make decisions to see the big picture, make sense of it, and do the right thing.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that some older boomers have already started to retire (congrats!) I?ve former colleagues who retired as early as 60.  </p>
<p>So to clear up any misconceptions, in my original post, I should have indicated I was mainly focusing on older boomers, those that are getting nearer to retirement within just a few years.    </p>
<p>This post is intended to be an explanation and an apology, I?m concerned it could potentially infuriate others further.  I?ll forgo that risk and make a public apology.</p>
<p>Humbly, Margie, (and anyone else) I seek your forgiveness and understanding as I continue to explore these generational issues as it ties to web strategy. </p>

<p>First of all, I?m sorry for offending you, I sincerely mean that, that was never my intent.  </p>
<p>Secondly, the post is based off data, and my duties in my day job, as it?s an accurate observation of what is, and what will happen.  In fact, I?m working on a Forrester report looking at how boomers use social media (coming in the next few weeks) so this is top of mind.  </p>
<p>As an analyst, it?s my job to categorize, segment, and describe trends, and for what it?s worth we didn?t create the ?boomers? classification.  </p>
<p>Regardless, Forrester classifies the Boomer generations in two segments, Younger Boomers (42-51) Older Boomers (52-62).  My previous post was obviously referring to the older boomers, and I?ll suspect that you Margy are of the younger group.</p>
<p>These aren?t pigeon holes, and nor are they intended to de-personalize the individual.  They are useful for those who make decisions to see the big picture, make sense of it, and do the right thing.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that some older boomers have already started to retire (congrats!) I?ve former colleagues who retired as early as 60.  </p>
<p>So to clear up any misconceptions, in my original post, I should have indicated I was mainly focusing on older boomers, those that are getting nearer to retirement within just a few years.    </p>
<p>This post is intended to be an explanation and an apology, I?m concerned it could potentially infuriate others further.  I?ll forgo that risk and make a public apology.</p>
<p>Humbly, Margie, (and anyone else) I seek your forgiveness and understanding as I continue to explore these generational issues as it ties to web strategy. </p>
